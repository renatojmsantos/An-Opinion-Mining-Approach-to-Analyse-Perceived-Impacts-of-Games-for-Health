	shorttitle = {Content {Analysis}},
	abstract = {Since the publication of the first edition of Content Analysis: An Introduction to Its Methodology, the textual fabric in which contemporary society functions has undergone a radical transformation -- namely, the ongoing information revolution. Two decades ago, content analysis was largely known in journalism and communication research, and, to a lesser extent, in the social and psychological sciences. Today, content analysis has become an efficient alternative to public opinion research -- a method of tracking markets, political leanings, and emerging ideas, a way to settle legal disputes, and an approach to explore individual human minds. The Second Edition of Content Analysis is a definitive sourcebook of the history and core principles of content analysis as well as an essential resource for present and future studies. The book introduces readers to ways of analyzing meaningful matter such as texts, images, voices -- that is, data whose physical manifestations are secondary to the meanings that a particular population of people brings to them.Organized into three parts, the book examines the conceptual and methodological aspects of content analysis and also traces several paths through content analysis protocols.The author has completely revised and updated the Second Edition, integrating new information on computer-aided text analysis. The book also includes a practical guide that incorporates experiences in teaching and how to advise academic and commercial researchers. In addition, Krippendorff clarifies the epistemology and logic of content analysis as well as the methods for achieving its aims. Author Klaus Krippendorff discusses three distinguishing characteristics of contemporary content analysis: that it is fundamentally empirically grounded, exploratory in process, and predictive or inferential in intent; that it transcends traditional notions of symbols, contents, and intents; and that it has been forced to develop a methodology of its own, one that enables researchers to plan, execute, communicate, reproduce, and critically evaluate an analysis independent of the desirability of its results.Intended as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate students across the social sciences, Content Analysis, Second Edition will also be a valuable resource for practitioners in a variety of disciplines.},

	abstract = {We provide a benchmark measuring star schema queries retrieving data from a fact table with Where clause column restrictions on dimension tables. Clustering is crucial to performance with modern disk technology, since retrievals with filter factors down to 0.0005 are now performed most efficiently by sequential table search rather than by indexed access. DB2's Multi-Dimensional Clustering (MDC) provides methods to “dice” the fact table along a number of orthogonal “dimensions”, but only when these dimensions are columns in the fact table. The diced cells cluster fact rows on several of these “dimensions” at once so queries restricting several such columns can access crucially localized data, with much faster query response. Unfortunately, columns of dimension tables of a star schema are not usually represented in the fact table. In this paper, we show a simple way to adjoin physical copies of dimension columns to the fact table, dicing data to effectively cluster query retrieval, and explain how such dicing can be achieved on database products other than DB2. We provide benchmark measurements to show successful use of this methodology on three commercial database products.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of smartphones has led to an increase in mobile health (mHealth) apps over the years. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate these apps by identifying shortcomings or barriers hampering effective delivery of intended services. In this paper, we evaluate 104 mental health apps on Google Play and App Store by performing sentiment analysis of 88125 user reviews using machine learning (ML), and then conducting thematic analysis on the reviews. We implement and compare the performance of five classifiers using supervised ML algorithms that are widely used for solving classification problems. The best performing classifier, with F1-score of 89.42\%, was then used in predicting the sentiment polarity of reviews. Next, we conduct a thematic analysis of positive and negative reviews to identify themes representing various factors affecting the effectiveness of mental health apps positively and negatively. Our results uncover 21 negative themes and 29 positive themes. The negative themes fall under the following categories: usability issues, content issues, ethical issues, customer support issues, and billing issues. Some of the positive themes include aesthetically pleasing interface, app stability, customizability, high-quality content, content variation/diversity, personalized content, privacy and security, and low-subscription cost. Finally, we offer design recommendations on how the identified negative factors can be tackled to improve the effectiveness of mental health apps.},

We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a goldstandard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

In all, 2108 usable replies were received from a postal survey of a targeted population of 5400 men and women, aged 18 and over and randomly selected with constraints for age, sex and socio-economic status. The prevalence of concern about physical appearance was highest among women through to age 60 and younger men. There was no association with socio-economic status or living status. Concerns about the nose, weight and skin disorders were reported most frequently by both men and women and additionally concerns about breasts and abdomen were reported by women and premature balding by men. The mean DAS24 and DAS59 full-scale scores of 19\% of male and 25\% of female responders who were concerned about appearance exceeded the mean scores of preoperative patients undergoing reconstructive and cosmetic plastic surgery. Concern about appearance is widespread in the general population. More often than not, concern is about one feature only, which runs counter to the hypothesis that concern about appearance reflects a neurotic trait. The high levels of measured psychological distress and dysfunction found in a substantial minority of those in the general population who are concerned about appearance highlight the need for appropriate services.},

	abstract = {Should brands continue to espouse the traditional thin female models in advertisements or follow the trend towards using larger-sized models? Although the effects of model body size in advertising has been investigated in literature, much inconclusive evidence remains. This study re-examines this important topic from the perspectives of social comparison and self-congruity and investigates the impact of different model body sizes on consumer well-being measures and advertising effectiveness, specifically examining a salient mediating mechanism and boundary conditions to the effect. Across two studies using different brand categories (fast fashion and luxury), we find that, women generally assimilate to an average-sized model over a thin-sized or plus-sized model in advertising. This, however, did not affect their subsequent body satisfaction. Moreover, women’s body mass index (BMI) moderated the mediating relationship between model size and purchase intentions via perceived similarity to the model. These findings implicate more support for realistic model portrayals in advertising.},

Mirror exposure therapy has been shown to benefit individuals with high body dissatisfaction and patients with eating disorders (ED) in clinical trials.

However, most clinical trials of mirror exposure therapy have been small or uncontrolled and have included few male subjects. Adverse events have been reported during mirror exposure clinical trials. We discuss how individuals respond when looking in a mirror and how mirrors can be used therapeutically, and we critically evaluate the evidence in favor of mirror exposure therapy.

	abstract = {There has been growing interest in the potential of ‘big data’ to enhance our understanding in medicine and public health. Although there is no agreed definition of big data, accepted critical components include greater volume, complexity, coverage and speed of availability. Much of these data are ‘found’ (as opposed to ‘made’), in that they have been collected for non-research purposes, but could include valuable information for research. The aim of this paper is to review the contribution of ‘found’ data to obesity research to date, and describe the benefits and challenges encountered. A narrative review was conducted to identify and collate peer-reviewed research studies. Database searches conducted up to September 2017 found original studies using a variety of data types and sources. These included: retail sales, transport, geospatial, commercial weight management data, social media, and smartphones and wearable technologies. The narrative review highlights the variety of data uses in the literature: describing the built environment, exploring social networks, estimating nutrient purchases or assessing the impact of interventions. The examples demonstrate four significant ways in which ‘found’ data can complement conventional ‘made’ data: firstly, in moving beyond constraints in scope (coverage, size and temporality); secondly, in providing objective, quantitative measures; thirdly, in reaching hard-to-access population groups; and lastly in the potential for evaluating real-world interventions. Alongside these opportunities, ‘found’ data come with distinct challenges, such as: ethical and legal questions around access and ownership; commercial sensitivities; costs; lack of control over data acquisition; validity; representativeness; finding appropriate comparators; and complexities of data processing, management and linkage. Despite widespread recognition of the opportunities, the impact of ‘found’ data on academic obesity research has been limited. The merit of such data lies not in their novelty, but in the benefits they could add over and above, or in combination with, conventionally collected data.},

In this study, the scientific literature about SBs and SNs was narratively reviewed. Some authors focus on detecting at-risk populations through data mining, identification of risks factors, and web activity patterns. Others describe prevention practices on the Internet, such as websites, screening, and applications. Targeted interventions through SNs are also contemplated when suicidal ideation is present. Multiple predictive models should be defined, implemented, tested, and combined in order to deal with the risk of SB through an effective decision support system. This endeavor might require a reorganization of care for SNs users presenting suicidal ideation.},

This article assesses the potential of social network services for social science research in two ways. First, it is argued that social scientists conduct hyperlink analysis differently to applied physicists and researchers from the library and information sciences, and face constraints (relating to theory, methods and availability of appropriate tools) that are not encountered in the other disciplinary approaches. However, the constraints regarding theory and methods are less likely to be faced by researchers of online social networks, and for this reason, the rise of Facebook and other similar services is a potential boon for empirical social scientists interested in networks. The second part of the article focuses specifically on the availability of research tools, and it is argued that social network services may eventually serve as e-Research platforms for delivering social network analysis tools.},

	abstract = {Since the last decade, most of our daily activities have become digital. Digital health takes into account the ever-increasing synergy between advanced medical technologies, innovation, and digital communication. Thanks to machine learning, we are not limited anymore to a descriptive analysis of the data, as we can obtain greater value by identifying and predicting patterns resulting from inductive reasoning. Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for “what-if” models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability. In this context, new digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are certainly a great opportunity. Herein, we report the results of a careful analysis of the current literature and represent the vision of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD) on this controversial topic that, if well used, may be the key for a great scientific innovation. AMD believes that the use of artificial intelligence will enable the conversion of data (descriptive) into knowledge of the factors that “affect” the behavior and correlations (predictive), thereby identifying the key aspects that may establish an improvement of the expected results (prescriptive). Artificial intelligence can therefore become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine. This, in turn, will allow for comprehensive therapies to be built in accordance with the evidence criteria that should always be the ground for any therapeutic choice.},

If a company understands the preferred types of posts (photo or video) of its customers, based on their reactions, it could make use of these preferences in designing its future communication strategy. The study examines how the use of SM technology and customer-centric management systems could contribute to sustainable business development of companies by means of social customer relationship management (sCRM). The two companies included in the study provide a general consumer good in the beverage industry. As such, it may be said that users interacting with the posts these companies make on their official channels are in fact customers or potential customers. The study aims to analyze customer reaction to two types of posts (photos or videos) on six social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+ and Youtube. It brings evidence on the differences and similarities between the SM customer behaviors of two highly competitive brands in the beverage industry. Drawing on current literature on SM, sCRM and marketing, the output of this study is the conceptualization and measurement of a brand’s SM ability to understand customer preferences for different types of posts by using various statistical tools and the sentiment analysis (SA) technique applied to big sets of data.},

We rely on tree kernels to automatically extract and learn features with better generalization power than traditionally used bag-of-word models. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that (i) STRUCT outperforms the bag-of-words model both within the same domain (up to 2.6\% and 3\% of absolute improvement for Italian and English, respectively); (ii) it is particularly useful when tested across domains (up to more than 4\% absolute improvement for both languages), especially when little training data is available (up to 10\% absolute improvement) and (iii) the proposed structure is also effective in a lower-resource language scenario, where only less accurate linguistic processing tools are available.},

Therefore, we developed a new scale to measure aesthetic pleasure and included scales to measure its known determinants for discriminant validity purposes, which automatically led to validating these determinants as well. In the exploratory phase, we identified highly reliable items representative of aesthetic pleasure and its determinants across product categories. In the validation phase, we confirmed these findings across different countries (Australia, the Netherlands, and Taiwan). The final scale consists of 5 items, “beautiful,” “attractive,” “pleasing to see,” “nice to see,” and “like to look at,” that together reliably capture the construct of aesthetic pleasure. Several recommendations are formulated regarding the application of this scale in design studies and beyond.},

We ﬁnd that, on average, the conversion rate of a product can increase by as much as 270\% as it accumulates reviews, amongst the users that choose to display them. We also ﬁnd diminishing marginal value as a product accumulates reviews, with the ﬁrst ﬁve reviews driving the bulk of the aforementioned increase. To address the problem of simultaneity of increase of reviews and conversion rate, we use customer sessions in which reviews were not displayed as a control for trends that would have happened regardless of the increase in the review volume. Using our framework, we further ﬁnd that high priced items have a higher value for reviews than lower priced items. High priced items can see their conversion rate increase by as much as 380\% as they accumulate reviews compared to 190\% for low priced items.We infer that the existence of reviews provides valuable signals to the customers, increasing their propensity to purchase. We also infer that users usually don’t pay attention to the entire set of reviews, especially if there are a lot of them, but instead they focus on the ﬁrst few available. Our approach can be extended and applied in a variety of settings to gain further insights.},

	title = {Mining and {Summarizing} {Customer} {Reviews}},
	abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

How can we characterize them and better understand the role they might play in helping create and shape our understanding of games? This article reports on the results of a study that analyzed and deconstructed a selection of game reviews from popular online websites. Our findings show that game reviews are rich and varied in terms of themes and topics covered and that considering them purely as “shopping guides” ignores the broader role they play in the discourse of games. We found that game reviews often include game design suggestions, hypothesize about the intentions and goals of game creators, and offer advice to readers on how to approach and best enjoy particular games. More generally, game reviews can also help preserve videogame history by contextualizing the links and historical connections that exist between games.},

	abstract = {Online reviews provide consumers with valuable information that guides their decisions on a variety of fronts: from entertainment and shopping to medical services. Although the proliferation of online reviews gives insights about diﬀerent aspects of a product, it can also prove a serious drawback: consumers cannot and will not read thousands of reviews before making a purchase decision. This need to extract useful information from large review corpora has spawned considerable prior work, but so far all have drawbacks. Review summarization (generating statistical descriptions of review sets) sacriﬁces the immediacy and narrative structure of reviews. Likewise, review selection (identifying a subset of ‘helpful’ or ‘important’ reviews) leads to redundant or non-representative summaries. In this paper, we ﬁll the gap between existing review-summarization and review-selection methods by selecting a small subset of reviews that together preserve the statistical properties of the entire review corpus. We formalize this task as a combinatorial optimization problem and show that it NP-hard both to solve and approximate. We also design eﬀective algorithms that prove to work well in practice. Our experiments with real review corpora on diﬀerent types of products demonstrate the utility of our methods, and our user studies indicate that our methods provide a better summary than prior approaches.},

These online stores help users discover apps as well as leave a review. Ratings and reviews add value to both the developer and potential new users by providing a crowd-sourced indicator of app quality. Hence, for developers it is important to get positive reviews and high ratings to ensure that an app has a viable future. But, what exactly do users say on these app stores? And more importantly, what is the experience that compels a user to leave either a positive or a negative rating? Our analysis of 8.7 million reviews from 17,330 apps shows that users tend to leave short, yet informative reviews, and the rating as well as the category influences the length of a review. In this preliminary study, we found that users will leave longer messages when they rate an app poorly, and the depth of feedback in certain categories is significantly higher than for other.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, users’ ability to publish content has created active electronic communities that provide a wealth of product information. Consumers naturally gravitate to reading reviews in order to decide whether to buy a product. However, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes it harder for individuals to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product based on the reviews. Similarly, the manufacturer of a product needs to identify the reviews that inﬂuence the customer base, and examine the content of these reviews. In this paper, we propose two ranking mechanisms for ranking product reviews: a consumer-oriented ranking mechanism ranks the reviews according to their expected helpfulness, and a manufactureroriented ranking mechanism ranks the reviews according to their expected eﬀect on sales. Our ranking mechanism combines econometric analysis with text mining techniques in general, and with subjectivity analysis in particular. We show that subjectivity analysis can give useful clues about the helpfulness of a review and about its impact on sales. Our results can have several implications for the market design of online opinion forums.},

A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a SLR which includes grey literature in addition to the published (formal) literature. Only a few MLRs have been published in SE so far. We aim at raising the awareness for MLRs in SE by addressing two research questions (RQs): (1) What types of knowledge are missed when a SLR does not include the multivocal literature in a SE field? and (2) What do we, as a community, gain when we include the multivocal literature and conduct MLRs? To answer these RQs, we sample a few example SLRs and MLRs and identify the missing and the gained knowledge due to excluding or including the grey literature. We find that (1) grey literature can give substantial benefits in certain areas of SE, and that (2) the inclusion of grey literature brings forward certain challenges as evidence in them is often experience and opinion based. Given these conflicting viewpoints, the authors are planning to prepare systematic guidelines for performing MLRs in SE.},

Hence, this paper tackles the challenge of uncovering crowdsourced manipulation of online reviews through a three-part eﬀort: (i) First, we propose a novel sampling method for identifying products that have been targeted for manipulation and a seed set of deceptive reviewers who have been enlisted through crowdsourcing platforms. (ii) Second, we augment this base set of deceptive reviewers through a reviewer-reviewer graph clustering approach based on a Markov Random Field where we deﬁne individual potentials (of single reviewers) and pair potentials (between two reviewers). (iii) Finally, we embed the results of this probabilistic model into a classiﬁcation framework for detecting crowd-manipulated reviews. We ﬁnd that the proposed approach achieves up to 0.96 AUC, outperforming both traditional detection methods and a SimRank-based alternative clustering approach.},

While automation systems have been a realm for highly specialized tasks and trained experts until recently, now more and more non-expert users encounter automated systems in their everyday life. The deployment of these systems fundamentally changes practices and experiences in various domains. The overall goal of this workshop is to investigate the requirements and design criteria for automation that are experienced in everyday situations. In particular we will strive to come up with a set of principles for three key areas of everyday automation experience: intelligibility, experienced control, and capturing automation experience. This way, the workshop provides a first forum for knowledge exchange and networking across usage domains and contexts.},

There are now numerous Web sites containing such opinions, e.g., customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. This paper focuses on online customer reviews of products. It makes two contributions. First, it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products. A prototype system called Opinion Observer is also implemented. The system is such that with a single glance of its visualization, the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. This comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers. For a potential customer, he/she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products, which helps him/her to decide which product to buy. For a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. Second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from Pros and Cons in a particular type of reviews. Such features form the basis for the above comparison. Experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly.},

In this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. We present a Bayesian classiﬁer for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the signiﬁcantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. We also present a ﬁrst model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. Results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classiﬁcation (upwards of 97\% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91\% accuracy).},

	abstract = {Aspect-based opinion mining is widely applied to review data to aggregate or summarize opinions of a product, and the current stateof-the-art is achieved with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based model. Although social media data like tweets are laden with opinions, their “dirty” nature (as natural language) has discouraged researchers from applying LDA-based opinion model for product review mining. Tweets are often informal, unstructured and lacking labeled data such as categories and ratings, making it challenging for product opinion mining. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based opinion model named Twitter Opinion Topic Model (TOTM) for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. TOTM leverages hashtags, mentions, emoticons and strong sentiment words that are present in tweets in its discovery process. It improves opinion prediction by modeling the target-opinion interaction directly, thus discovering target speciﬁc opinion words, neglected in existing approaches. Moreover, we propose a new formulation of incorporating sentiment prior information into a topic model, by utilizing an existing public sentiment lexicon. This is novel in that it learns and updates with the data. We conduct experiments on 9 million tweets on electronic products, and demonstrate the improved performance of TOTM in both quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis. We show that aspect-based opinion analysis on massive volume of tweets provides useful opinions on products.},

A relevant document must satisfy two criteria: relevant to the query topic, and contains opinions about the query, no matter if they are positive or negative. In this paper, we describe an opinion retrieval algorithm. It has a traditional information retrieval (IR) component to find topic relevant documents from a document set, an opinion classification component to find documents having opinions from the results of the IR step, and a component to rank the documents based on their relevance to the query, and their degrees of having opinions about the query. We implemented the algorithm as a working system and tested it using TREC 2006 Blog Track data in automatic title-only runs. Our result showed 28\% to 32\% improvements in MAP score over the best automatic runs in this 2006 track. Our result is also 13\% higher than a state-of-art opinion retrieval system, which is tested on the same data set.},

	abstract = {One of the important types of information on the Web is the opinions expressed in the user generated content, e.g., customer reviews of products, forum posts, and blogs. In this paper, we focus on customer reviews of products. In particular, we study the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. This problem has many applications, e.g., opinion mining, summarization and search. Most existing techniques utilize a list of opinion (bearing) words (also called opinion lexicon) for the purpose. Opinion words are words that express desirable (e.g., great, amazing, etc.) or undesirable (e.g., bad, poor, etc) states. These approaches, however, all have some major shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solving the problem by exploiting external evidences and linguistic conventions of natural language expressions. This approach allows the system to handle opinion words that are context dependent, which cause major difficulties for existing algorithms. It also deals with many special words, phrases and language constructs which have impacts on opinions based on their linguistic patterns. It also has an effective function for aggregating multiple conflicting opinion words in a sentence. A system, called Opinion Observer, based on the proposed technique has been implemented. Experimental results using a benchmark product review data set and some additional reviews show that the proposed technique is highly effective. It outperforms existing methods significantly.},

These anomalies impair interaction and require the user to take corrective measures, such as resetting the text cursor or correcting the trajectory of the pointer to reach a desired target. Impairments can result from software bugs, physical hardware defects, and extraneous input. However, some designs alter the course of interaction through covert impairments, anomalies introduced intentionally and without the user’s knowledge. There are various motivations for doing so rooted in disparate ﬁelds including biometrics, electronic voting, and entertainment. We examine this kind of deception by systematizing four diﬀerent ways computer interaction may become impaired and three diﬀerent goals of the designer, providing insight to the design of systems that implement covert impairments.},

The framework outlines five distinct senses of the experience of meaning: connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and significance. We illustrate the usefulness of the framework by analyzing a selection of recent papers at the CHI conference and by raising a series of open research questions about the interplay of meaning, user experience, reflection, and well-being.},

In this paper we present a systematic review of the use of nudging in HCI research with the goal of laying out the design space of technology-mediated nudging –the why (i.e., which cognitive biases do nudges combat) and the how (i.e., what exact mechanisms do nudges employ to incur behavior change). All in all, we found 23 distinct mechanisms of nudging, grouped in 6 categories, and leveraging 15 different cognitive biases.

This is partly because it remains unclear how they perform compared to model-based approaches as well as dominant, special-purpose eye tracking equipment. To address this limitation, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art appearance-based gaze estimation for interaction scenarios with and without personal calibration, indoors and outdoors, for different sensing distances, as well as for users with and without glasses. We discuss the obtained findings and their implications for the most important gaze-based applications, namely explicit eye input, attentive user interfaces, gaze-based user modelling, and passive eye monitoring. To democratise the use of appearance-based gaze estimation and interaction in HCI, we finally present OpenGaze (www.opengaze.org), the first software toolkit for appearance-based gaze estimation and interaction.},

While automation systems have been a realm for highly specialized tasks and trained experts until recently, now more and more non-expert users encounter automated systems in their everyday life. The deployment of these systems fundamentally changes practices and experiences in various domains. The overall goal of this workshop is to investigate the requirements and design criteria for automation that are experienced in everyday situations. In particular we will strive to come up with a set of principles for three key areas of everyday automation experience: intelligibility, experienced control, and capturing automation experience. This way, the workshop provides a first forum for knowledge exchange and networking across usage domains and contexts.},

In this paper, we study the application of location based sentiment analysis using Twitter for identifying trends and patterns towards the Indian general elections 2014. We perform data (text) mining on 650,000 tweets collected over a period of 5 days pertaining to two political parties in India, during the campaigning period. We make use of Naive Bayes algorithm to build our classifier and classify the test data (as positive or negative) according to it. We identify the sentiment of Twitter users towards each of the two Indian political parties, by location and plot our findings on an Indian map. In the end, we present our observations and conclusions and how certain "social events" influence the sentiments of Twitter users on the social network. We also discuss the issues related to geo-location using the data obtained from the Twitter API.},

Software engineering researchers have never had available, a more rich, wide and varied source of information about software products. There is some source code availability, supporting scientiﬁc investigation as it does with more traditional open source systems. However, what is important and diﬀerent about app stores, is the other data available. Researchers can access user perceptions, expressed in rating and review data. Information is also available on app popularity (typically expressed as the number or rank of downloads). For more traditional applications, this data would simply be too commercially sensitive for public release. Pricing information is also partially available, though at the time of writing, this is sadly submerging beneath a more opaque layer of in-app purchasing.

We have built PlayDrone, the ﬁrst scalable Google Play store crawler, and used it to index and analyze over 1,100,000 applications in the Google Play store on a daily basis, the largest such index of Android applications. PlayDrone leverages various hacking techniques to circumvent Google’s roadblocks for indexing Google Play store content, and makes proprietary application sources available, including source code for over 880,000 free applications. We demonstrate the usefulness of PlayDrone in decompiling and analyzing application content by exploring four previously unaddressed issues: the characterization of Google Play application content at large scale and its evolution over time, library usage in applications and its impact on application portability, duplicative application content in Google Play, and the ineﬀectiveness of OAuth and related service authentication mechanisms resulting in malicious users being able to easily gain unauthorized access to user data and resources on Amazon Web Services and Facebook.},

Previous research suggests that Twitter should be used as an additional resource to receive users’ feedback, as app users tweet different issues. Although the classification and review summarization methods are developed previously for each platform separately, manual investigation of reviews or tweets is still required to identify the similar or different points that are discussed on App Store or Twitter. In this paper, we propose a framework to study the differences or similarities among app reviews from Google Play Store and tweets automatically by using the semantics of the words. The results from several experiments compared with expert evaluation, confirm that it can be applied to identify the similarities or differences among the extracted topics, n-grams, and users’ comments.},

Unlike other software repositories traditionally used in MSR work, app stores usually do not provide source code. However, they do provide a wealth of other information in the form of pricing and customer reviews. Therefore, we use data mining to extract feature information, which we then combine with more readily available information to analyse apps’ technical, customer and business aspects. We applied our approach to the 32,108 non-zero priced apps available in the Blackberry app store in September 2011. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between customer rating and the rank of app downloads, though perhaps surprisingly, there is no correlation between price and downloads, nor between price and rating. More importantly, we show that these correlation ﬁndings carry over to (and are even occasionally enhanced within) the space of data mined app features, providing evidence that our ‘App store MSR’ approach can be valuable to app developers.},

We present a 2D interactive visualization of the OLAP cube based on a checkerboard that enables isolating and interpreting signiﬁcant measure diﬀerences between two similar cuboids, which diﬀer in one dimension and have the same values on the remaining dimensions.

Besides, algebras for ﬁeld manipulation have been proposed, but they are representation-dependent and not closed. To address this problems, we propose a (closed) generic map algebra over spatio-temporal continuous ﬁelds, independent of the underlying ﬁeld representation. Based on this algebra, we deﬁne a language that allows analyzing continuous ﬁelds data and OLAP cubes together, using the traditional OLAP operations, providing a very general framework for spatio-temporal data analysis.},

On the other hand, for data analytics in a broad sense, there are plenty of non-DBMS tools including statistical languages, matrix packages, generic data mining programs and largescale parallel systems, being the main technology for big data analytics. Such large-scale systems are mostly based on the Hadoop distributed ﬁle system and MapReduce. Thus it would seem a DBMS is not a good technology to analyze big data, going beyond SQL queries, acting just as a reliable and fast data repository. In this survey, we argue that is not the case, explaining important research that has enabled analytics on large databases inside a DBMS. However, we also argue DBMSs cannot compete with parallel systems like MapReduce to analyze web-scale text data. Therefore, each technology will keep inﬂuencing each other. We conclude with a proposal of long-term research issues, considering the “big data analytics” trend.},

	abstract = {Star schema, which maintains one-to-many relationships between dimensions and a fact table, is widely accepted as the most viable data representation for dimensional analysis. Real- world DW schema, however, frequently includes many-to-many relationships between a dimension and a fact table. Having those relationships in a dimensional model causes several difficult issues, such as losing the simplicity of the star schema structure, increasing complexity in forming queries, and degrading query performance by adding more joins. Therefore, it is desirable to represent the many-to-many relationships with correct semantics while still keeping the structure of the star schema. In this paper, we analyze many-to-many relationships between a dimension table and a fact table in dimensional modeling. We illustrate six different approaches and show the advantages and disadvantages of each. We propose two ad-hoc methods that maintain a star schema structure by denormalizing the dimensions to avoid many-to- many relationships. This method allows quick query processing by using a concatenated attribute with minimal overhead. Other issues addressed are data redundancy, weighting factors, storage requirements, and performance concerns.},

@article{liu_sentiment_2010,
	title = {Sentiment analysis and subjectivity},
	abstract = {Textual information in the world can be broadly categorized into two main types: facts and opinions. Facts are objective expressions about entities, events and their properties. Opinions are usually subjective expressions that describe people's sentiments, appraisals or feelings toward entities, events and their properties. The concept of opinion is very broad. In this chapter, we only focus on opinion expressions that convey people's positive or negative sentiments. Much of the existing research on textual information processing has been focused on mining and retrieval of factual information, e.g., information retrieval, Web search, text classification, text clustering and many other text mining and natural language processing tasks. Little work had been done on the processing of opinions until only recently. Yet, opinions are so important that whenever we need to make a decision we want to hear others' opinions. This is not only true for individuals but also true for organizations. One of the main reasons for the lack of study on opinions is the fact that there was little opinionated text available before the World Wide Web. Before the Web, when an individual needed to make a decision, he/she typically asked for opinions from friends and families. When an organization wanted to find the opinions or sentiments of the general public about its products and services, it conducted opinion polls, surveys, and focus groups. However, with the Web, especially with the explosive growth of the user-generated content on the Web in the past few years, the world has been transformed. The Web has dramatically changed the way that people express their views and opinions. They can now post reviews of products at merchant sites and express their views on almost anything in Internet forums, discussion groups, and blogs, which are collectively called the user-generated content. This online word-of-mouth behavior represents new and measurable sources of information with many practical applications. Now if one wants to buy a product, he/she is no longer limited to asking his/her friends and families because there are many product reviews on the Web which give opinions of existing users of the product. For a company, it may no longer be necessary to conduct surveys, organize focus groups or employ external consultants in order to find consumer opinions about its products and those of its competitors because the user-generated content on the Web can already give them such information.},

The ISO definition suggests measures of user experience are similar to measures of satisfaction in usability. A survey at Nokia showed that user experience was interpreted in a similar way to usability, but with the addition of anticipation and hedonic responses. CHI 2009 SIG participants identified not just measurement methods, but methods that help understanding of how and why people use products. A distinction can be made between usability methods that have the objective of improving human performance, and user experience methods that have the objective of improving user satisfaction with achieving both pragmatic and hedonic goals. Sometimes the term “user experience” is used to refer to both approaches.},

	abstract = {Approximately 20\% of adults worldwide report persistent fatigue. Physical activity is a healthful behaviour that has promise for combating feelings of fatigue and low energy. This article summarises the epidemiological literature that examined the association between physical activity and feelings of energy and fatigue. Twelve population-based studies conducted between January 1945 and February 2005 that concurrently measured physical activity and feelings of energy and fatigue were located. All of the studies suggested that there was an association between physical activity and a reduced risk of experiencing feelings of low energy and fatigue when active adults were compared with sedentary peers (odds ratio = 0.61; 95\% CI 0.52, 0.72). The effect was heterogeneous and varied according to study design and the energy/fatigue measure used in the study. Because epidemiological comparisons cannot establish direction of causality, standard criteria for evaluating strength of evidence in epidemiological studies (i.e. strength of association, temporal sequence, consistency, dose response and biological plausibility) were used to judge whether the observed association between physical activity and feelings of energy and fatigue suggest causality in the absence of adequate experimental evidence. There was agreement among the studies suggesting a strong, consistent, temporally appropriate dose-response relationship between physical activity and feelings of energy and fatigue. No compelling evidence has confirmed any plausible biological mechanisms that explain the apparent protective effect of physical activity against feelings of low energy and fatigue. Nonetheless, the epidemiological evidence is sufficiently strong to justify better controlled prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discomfort is a concept found in the literature, usually related to pain. Some sources do not distinguish between pain and discomfort. Others refer to different sources of discomfort, thereby leading to a lack of conceptual clarity.
AIMS: The objective of this paper was to present a concept analysis of discomfort. Full-text articles published between 1970 and 2016 in English were used to inform the concept analysis.
DESIGN: Articles were taken from CINAHL, Medline and PsycNET databases.
METHODS: A total of 7,406 articles and 120 abstracts were identified for evaluation. After initial review, 42 articles were further analyzed. Two reviewers independently evaluated the selected publications using the Walker and Avant approach to concept analysis.
RESULTS: Discomfort can be physical or psychological and is characterized by an unpleasant feeling resulting in a natural response of avoidance or reduction of the source of the discomfort. Pain is one of the causes for discomfort, but not every discomfort can be attributed to pain. It is identified by self-report or observation. Discomfort in noncommunicative patients is assessed and measured via behavioral expression, also used to describe pain and agitation, leading to discomfort being interpreted as pain in some conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: A clarification of the concept of discomfort leads to a more accurate theoretical and operational definition. This clarification can help nurses to make more accurate nursing diagnoses and develop methods to measure discomfort in order to provide optimal quality of nursing care.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a malignant disease that has caused millions of human deaths. Its study has a long history of well over 100years. There have been an enormous number of publications on cancer research. This integrated but unstructured biomedical text is of great value for cancer diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. The immense body and rapid growth of biomedical text on cancer has led to the appearance of a large number of text mining techniques aimed at extracting novel knowledge from scientific text. Biomedical text mining on cancer research is computationally automatic and high-throughput in nature. However, it is error-prone due to the complexity of natural language processing. In this review, we introduce the basic concepts underlying text mining and examine some frequently used algorithms, tools, and data sets, as well as assessing how much these algorithms have been utilized. We then discuss the current state-of-the-art text mining applications in cancer research and we also provide some resources for cancer text mining. With the development of systems biology, researchers tend to understand complex biomedical systems from a systems biology viewpoint. Thus, the full utilization of text mining to facilitate cancer systems biology research is fast becoming a major concern. To address this issue, we describe the general workflow of text mining in cancer systems biology and each phase of the workflow. We hope that this review can (i) provide a useful overview of the current work of this field; (ii) help researchers to choose text mining tools and datasets; and (iii) highlight how to apply text mining to assist cancer systems biology research.},

Text expresses a vast, rich range of information, but encodes this information in a form that is difficult to decipher automatically. Perhaps for this reason, there has been little work in text data mining to date, and most people who have talked about it have either conflated it with information access or have not made use of text directly to discover heretofore unknown information. In this paper I will first define data mining, information access, and corpus-based computational linguistics, and then discuss the relationship of these to text data mining. The intent behind these contrasts is to draw attention to exciting new kinds of problems for computational linguists. I describe examples of what I consider to be real text data mining efforts and briefly outline recent ideas about how to pursue exploratory data analysis over text.},

	abstract = {An exploration of the way videogames mount arguments and make expressive statements about the world that analyzes their unique persuasive power in terms of their computational properties.
                Videogames are an expressive medium, and a persuasive medium; they represent how real and imagined systems work, and they invite players to interact with those systems and form judgments about them. In this innovative analysis, Ian Bogost examines the way videogames mount arguments and influence players. Drawing on the 2,500-year history of rhetoric, the study of persuasive expression, Bogost analyzes rhetoric's unique function in software in general and videogames in particular. The field of media studies already analyzes visual rhetoric, the art of using imagery and visual representation persuasively. Bogost argues that videogames, thanks to their basic representational mode of procedurality (rule-based representations and interactions), open a new domain for persuasion; they realize a new form of rhetoric. Bogost calls this new form "procedural rhetoric," a type of rhetoric tied to the core affordances of computers: running processes and executing rule-based symbolic manipulation. He argues further that videogames have a unique persuasive power that goes beyond other forms of computational persuasion. Not only can videogames support existing social and cultural positions, but they can also disrupt and change these positions themselves, leading to potentially significant long-term social change. Bogost looks at three areas in which videogame persuasion has already taken form and shows considerable potential: politics, advertising, and learning.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet has not only generated huge volumes of unstructured information in the form of web documents, but a large amount of text is also generated in the form of emails, blogs, and feedbacks etc. The data generated from online communication acts as potential gold mines for discovering knowledge. Text analytics has matured and is being successfully employed to mine important information from unstructured text documents. Most of these techniques use Natural Language Processing techniques which assume that the underlying text is clean and correct. Statistical techniques, though not as accurate as linguistic mechanisms, are also employed for the purpose to overcome the dependence on clean text. The chief bottleneck for designing statistical mechanisms is however its dependence on appropriately annotated training data. None of these methodologies are suitable for mining information from online communication text data due to the fact that they are often noisy. These texts are informally written. They suffer from spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, improper punctuation and irrational capitalization. This paper focuses on opinion extraction from noisy text data. It is aimed at extracting and consolidating opinions of customers from blogs and feedbacks, at multiple levels of granularity. Ours is a hybrid approach, in which we initially employ a semi-supervised method to learn domain knowledge from a training repository which contains both noisy and clean text. Thereafter we employ localized linguistic techniques to extract opinion expressions from noisy text. We have developed a system based on this approach, which provides the user with a platform to analyze opinion expressions extracted from a repository.},

Text mining applications rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like tagger, parser etc. to locate and retrieve relevant information in an application specific manner. Most of these NLP tools however have been designed to work on clean and grammatically correct text. Presently, many organizations are interested to derive information from informally written text that is generated as a result of human communication through emails, or blog posts, web-based reviews etc. These texts are highly noisy and often found to contain mixture of languages. In this study we present some analysis on how noise introduced due to incorrect English affects the performance of some of the NLP tools and thereafter the text mining applications. The text mining application that we focus on is opinion mining. Opinion mining is the most significant text mining application that has to deal with noisy text generated in an unregulated fashion by users.},

There has been a recent increase in the number of commercial text mining product and service oﬀerings, but successful or wide-spread deployments are rare, mainly due to a dependence on the expertise and skill of practitioners. Accordingly, there is a growing need for re-usable repositories for text mining. In this paper, we focus on dictionary-based text mining and its role in enabling practitioners in understanding and analyzing large text datasets. We motivate and deﬁne the problem of exploratory dictionary construction for capturing concepts of interest, and propose a framework for eﬃcient construction, tuning, and re-use of these dictionaries across datasets. The construction framework offers a range of interaction modes to the user to quickly build concept dictionaries over large datasets. We also show how to adapt one or more dictionaries across domains and tasks, thereby enabling reuse of knowledge and eﬀort in industrial practice. We present results and case studies on real-life CRM analytics datasets, where such repositories and tooling signiﬁcantly cut down practitioner time and eﬀort for dictionary-based text mining.},

The model captures subjective expression from product reviews and transfers to fact table before representing in multi-dimensions named as customers, products, time and location.

Thus, evaluating the UX is essential to improve its quality. However, most UX evaluation techniques limit to indicate whether the UX was positive or negative, which makes it challenging to identify what must be corrected by the software development team. This paper presents UX-Tips (User eXperience for Interactive ProductS), a technique developed to deal with this limitation, whose main objective is to allow the identification of problems related to UX. We also present two empirical studies conducted to evaluate UX-Tips. In the first study, we assessed the feasibility of the technique concerning its primary goal. In the second study, we compared the performance of UX-Tips with a similar technique. The results showed that UXTips allowed the subjects to indicate whether the UX was negative, and the specific problems they detected. It also allowed more effective and efficient evaluations, in addition to being considered easier to use. In practice, UX-Tips enable the software development team to identify the problems that impair users’ experience, which should be fixed in order to provide a good UX.},

This approach allows document retrieval using domain-level inferences, and integration of repositories with heterogeneous media, languages and structure. Ontological anchoring is a two-way street: ontologies allow semantic indexing of documents, and simultaneously new documents enrich ontologies. The approach is illustrated with an initial deployment for heritage documents in Spanish.},

Summative evaluations of TagReﬁnery showed that it could effectively guide the novice users through the workﬂow by giving them brief but helpful explanations on why each step was required, and providing visual and statistical aids to help them in making important decisions. This is while our more expert users greatly appreciated the amount of control and granularity over the workﬂow that our more advanced interface mode offered. Both the underlying tag cleaning workﬂow and the interface were designed iteratively in a participatory design process in collaboration with research on a music recommendation interface based on Last.fm tags.},

	abstract = {One of the difﬁculties in using Folksonomies in computational systems is tag ambiguity: tags with multiple meanings. This paper presents a novel method for building Folksonomy tag ontologies in which the nodes are disambiguated. Our method utilizes a clustering algorithm called DSCBC, which was originally developed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), to derive committees of tags, each of which corresponds to one meaning or domain. In this work, we use Wikipedia as the external knowledge source for the domains of the tags. Using the committees, an ambiguous tag is identiﬁed as one which belongs to more than one committee. Then we apply a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to build an ontology of tags. The nodes in the derived ontology are disambiguated in that an ambiguous tag appears in several nodes in the ontology, each of which corresponds to one meaning of the tag. We evaluate the derived ontology for its ontological density (how close similar tags are placed), and its usefulness in applications, in particular for a personalized tag retrieval task. The results showed marked improvements over other approaches.},

	title = {Mining and {Summarizing} {Customer} {Reviews}},
	abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

However, the SG4D ﬁeld still has not been fully mapped out and classiﬁed. In this work, we present a generic taxonomy of serious games for dementia, based on the health functions and the health purposes they serve. Firstly, we classify dementia games based on the health function they serve, in: cognitive, physical and social-emotional games. Each of these functions serves a variety of health purposes, leading us to a second, lower level of classiﬁcation in: preventative, rehabilitative, assessing and educative games. Furthermore, we provide an ex-post evaluation of the proposed taxonomy by exploring whether the existing serious games for dementia can be validly classiﬁed, based on the proposed taxonomic characters. To this end, we collect and analyse a set of dementia-related serious games (e.g. WiiSports, Big Brain Academy, Cogniﬁt, MinWii, et al.) by performing a literature review. The results show that the taxonomical system covers a sub-ﬁeld of “games for health” and indicates areas which are under-explored by current games.},

We use these tasks to evaluate whether word and sequence embedding models pre-trained on biomedical literature can be used to derive meaningful document-level semantic representations for these publications. We evaluate approaches from two broad categories: (1) lexical pooling, or vectorizing documents purely based on aggregation of lexical items, which includes the NCBI’s BioWordVec model and Tf-idf-based vectorizations, both with and without word pre-filtering based on biomedical ontologies, (2) sequence embedding, which includes the NCBI’s BioSentVec model and BioBERT. For both of our tasks, lexical pooling outperformed sequence embedding, and the best overall method was mean pooling of BioWordVec word embeddings. We also include baselines trained on nonbiomedical English to show that training on biomedical literature is warranted. The methods discussed here have potential applications for clustering, comparing, analyzing and recommending scientific literature in the biomedical domain.},

We analyze the content and structure of 691 user-generated narratives on positive and negative experiences with technology. We use a multi-method approach consisting of manual (structural analysis of narratives) as well as of automated content analysis methods (psycholinguistic analysis and machine learning). These analyses show converging evidence that positive narratives predominantly concern social aspects such as family and friends. In addition, technology is positively experienced when it enables users to do things more efficiently or in a new way. In contrast, negative narratives often express anger and frustration due to technological failures. Our multi-method approach illustrates the potential of automated (as opposed to manual) content analysis methods for studying text-based experience reports.},

In case of recognizing emotion from a piece of text document or a blog, any human can do this better than a machine only problem is he/she takes time. Proposed emotion detector system takes a text document and the emotion word ontology as inputs and produces one of the six emotion classes (i.e. love, sadness, joy, fear and surprise, anger) as the output. Every input text contains some short stories which are firstly read and assigned an emotion class manually and then that emotion class is compared to the output of the proposed system to check the accuracy of the Proposed Emotion Detector System.

Explicit emotion recognition in text is the most addressed problem in the literature. The solution to this problem is mainly based on identifying keywords. Implicit emotion recognition is the most challenging problem to solve because such emotion is typically hidden within the text, and thus, its solution requires an understanding of the context. There are four main approaches for implicit emotion recognition in text: rule-based approaches, classical learning-based approaches, deep learning approaches, and hybrid approaches. In this paper, we critically survey the state-of-the-art research for explicit and implicit emotion recognition in text. We present the different approaches found in the literature, detail their main features, discuss their advantages and limitations, and compare them within tables. This study shows that hybrid approaches and learning-based approaches that utilize traditional text representation with distributed word representation outperform the other approaches on benchmark corpora. This paper also identiﬁes the sets of features that lead to the best-performing approaches; highlights the impacts of simple NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, on the performances of these approaches; and indicates some open problems.},

Thus, projects collecting emotionrelated data are proliferating, like social networks sentiment analysis or tracking students’ engagement to reduce Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) drop out rates. All them require a common way to represent emotions so it can be more easily integrated, shared and reused by applications improving user experience. Due to the complexity of this data, our proposal is to use rich semantic models based on ontology. EmotionsOnto is a generic ontology for describing emotions and their detection and expression systems taking contextual and multimodal elements into account. The ontology has been applied in the context of EmoCS, a project that collaboratively collects emotion common sense and models it using the EmotionsOnto and other ontologies. Currently, emotion input is provided manually by users. However, experiments are being conduced to automatically measure users’s emotional states using Brain–Computer Interfaces.},

	abstract = {Background: Ontologies are invaluable in the life sciences, but building and maintaining ontologies often requires a challenging number of distinct tasks such as running automated reasoners and quality control checks, extracting dependencies and application-specific subsets, generating standard reports, and generating release files in multiple formats. Similar to more general software development, automation is the key to executing and managing these tasks effectively and to releasing more robust products in standard forms. For ontologies using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), the OWL API Java library is the foundation for a range of software tools, including the Protégé ontology editor. In the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) community, we recognized the need to package a wide range of low-level OWL API functionality into a library of common higher-level operations and to make those operations available as a command-line tool.
Results: ROBOT (a recursive acronym for “ROBOT is an OBO Tool”) is an open source library and command-line tool for automating ontology development tasks. The library can be called from any programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Most usage is through the command-line tool, which runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. ROBOT provides ontology processing commands for a variety of tasks, including commands for converting formats, running a reasoner, creating import modules, running reports, and various other tasks. These commands can be combined into larger workflows using a separate task execution system such as GNU Make, and workflows can be automatically executed within continuous integration systems.
Conclusions: ROBOT supports automation of a wide range of ontology development tasks, focusing on OBO conventions. It packages common high-level ontology development functionality into a convenient library, and makes it easy to configure, combine, and execute individual tasks in comprehensive, automated workflows. This helps ontology developers to efficiently create, maintain, and release high-quality ontologies, so that they can spend more time focusing on development tasks. It also helps guarantee that released ontologies are free of certain types of logical errors and conform to standard quality control checks, increasing the overall robustness and efficiency of the ontology development lifecycle.},

	abstract = {Multi-label text classification has become progressively more important in recent years, where each document can be given multiple labels concurrently. Multi-label text classification is a main challenging task because of the large space of all potential label sets, which is exponential to the number of candidate labels. Among the disadvantages of the earlier multi-label classification methods is that they typically do not scale up with the number of specific labels and the number of training examples. A large amount of computational time for classification is required for a large amount of text documents with high dimensionality, especially, the Arabic language which has a very complex morphology and rich in nature. Furthermore, current researches have paid a little attention to the multi-label classification for Arabic text. Hence, this study aims to design and develop a new method for multi-label text classification for Arabic texts based on a binary relevance method. This binary relevance is made up from a different set of machine learning classifiers. The four multi-label classification approaches, namely: the set of SVM classifiers, the set of KNN classifiers, the set of NB classifiers and the set of the different type of classifiers were empirically evaluated in this research. Moreover, three feature selection methods (Odd ratio, Chi-square and Mutual information) were studied and their performances were investigated to enhance the performance of the Arabic multi-label text classification. The objective is to efficiently incorporate classification algorithms and feature selection to create a more accurate multi-label classification process. To evaluate the model, a manually standard interpreted data is used. The results show that the machine learning binary relevance classifiers which consists from a different set of machine learning classifiers attains the best result. It has achieved a good performance, with an overall F-measure of 86.8\% for the multi-label classification of Arabic text. Besides, the results show an important effect from the used feature selection methods on the classification. Distinctly, the set of the different set of algorithms proves to be an efficient and suitable method for the Arabic multi-label text classification.},

Additionally, we present an analytical study of ML benchmarks datasets and point out some shortcomings. As a result, this paper proposes the use of synthetic datasets to better analyze the behavior of ML methods in domains with different characteristics. To support this claim, we perform some experiments using synthetic data proving the competitive performance of BR with respect to a more complex method in difﬁcult problems with many labels, a conclusion which was not stated by previous studies.},

In contrast, corpus-based NLP tasks for unpopular languages (e.g. Vietnamese) are at a deadlock due to absence of annotated training data for these languages. Furthermore, hand-annotation of even reasonably well-determined features such as part-ofspeech (POS) tags has proved to be labor intensive and costly. In this paper, we suggest a solution to partially overcome the annotated resource shortage in Vietnamese by building a POS-tagger for an automatically word-aligned English-Vietnamese parallel Corpus (named EVC). This POS-tagger made use of the Transformation-Based Learning (or TBL) method to bootstrap the POS-annotation results of the English POS-tagger by exploiting the POS-information of the corresponding Vietnamese words via their wordalignments in EVC. Then, we directly project POSannotations from English side to Vietnamese via available word alignments. This POS-annotated Vietnamese corpus will be manually corrected to become an annotated training data for Vietnamese NLP tasks such as POS-tagger, Phrase-Chunker, Parser, Word-Sense Disambiguator, etc.},

Literature reports various eﬀorts made to develop tools and resources to process such noisy text for various languages, notably, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, an NLP task having a direct eﬀect on the performance of other successive text processing activities. Still, no such attempt has been made to develop a POS tagger for Urdu social media content. Thus, the focus of this paper is on POS tagging of Urdu tweets. We introduce a new tagset for POS-tagging of Urdu tweets along with the POS-tagged Urdu tweets corpus. We also investigated bootstrapping as a potential solution for overcoming the shortage of manually annotated data and present a supervised POS tagger with an accuracy of 93.8\% precision, 92.9\% recall and 93.3\% F-measure.},

In this proposal, ontologies are used to determine the context of the entities specified in the query. Our strategy for extracting the context is focused on concepts similarity. Each relevant term of the document is associated with an instance in the ontology.

	abstract = {The Web has come a long way since its invention by Berners-Lee, when it focused essentially on visualization and presentation of content for human consumption (Syntactic Web), to a Web providing meaningful content, facilitating the integration between people and machines (Semantic Web). This paper presents a survey of different tools that provide the enrichment of the Web with understandable annotation, in order to make its content available and interoperable between systems. We can group Semantic Annotation tools into the diverse dimensions: dynamicity, storage, information extraction process, scalability and customization. The analysis of the different annotation tools shows that (semi-)automatic and automatic systems aren’t as efficient as needed without human intervention and will continue to evolve to solve the challenge. Microdata, RDFa and the new HTML5 standard will certainly bring new contributions to this issue.},

	abstract = {Effectively managing the collaboration of many annotators is a crucial ingredient for the success of larger annotation projects. For collaboration, web-based tools offer a low-entry way gathering annotations from distributed contributors. While the management structure of annotation tools is more or less stable across projects, the kind of annotations vary widely between projects. The challenge for web-based tools for multi-layer text annotation is to combine ease of use and availability through the web with maximal ﬂexibility regarding the types and layers of annotations. In this chapter, we outline requirements for web-based annotation tools in detail and review a variety of tools in respect to these requirements. Further, we discuss two web-based multi-layer annotation tools in detail: GATE Teamware and WebAnno. While differing in some aspects, both tools largely fulﬁll the requirements for today’s web-based annotation tools. Finally, we point out further directions, such as increased schema ﬂexibility and tighter integration of automation for annotation suggestions.},

	abstract = {One way to increase the understanding of texts by machines is through adding semantic information to lexical items by including metadata tags, a process also called semantic annotation. There are several semantic aspects that can be added to the words, among them the information about the nature of the concept denoted through the association with a category of an ontology. The application of ontologies in the annotation task can span multiple domains. However, this particular research focused its approach on top-level ontologies due to its generalizing characteristic. Considering that annotation is an arduous task that demands time and specialized personnel to perform it, much is done on ways to implement the semantic annotation automatically. The use of machine learning techniques are the most effective approaches in the annotation process. Another factor of great importance for the success of the training process of the supervised learning algorithms is the use of a sufﬁciently large corpus and able to condense the linguistic variance of the natural language. In this sense, this article aims to present an automatic approach to enrich documents from the American English corpus through a CRF model for semantic annotation of ontologies from Schema.org top-level. The research uses two approaches of the model obtaining promising results for the development of semantic annotation based on top-level ontologies. Although it is a new line of research, the use of top-level ontologies for automatic semantic enrichment of texts can contribute signiﬁcantly to the improvement of text interpretation by machines.},

The models are efﬁcient and result in accurate performance on diverse transfer tasks. Two variants of the encoding models allow for trade-offs between accuracy and compute resources. For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We ﬁnd that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias.

To leverage such data for identifying usability issues, we (I) devise a methodology for building automated extraction tools for usability issues; (II) perform empirical assessment of such tools by training a number of classiﬁers to extract sentences describing usability issues for two digital cameras and a children’s tablet; (III) perform quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the usability issues identiﬁed by the classiﬁers and those identiﬁed and assessed by two traditional methods: heuristic evaluation and think aloud testing. Our results show that it is possible to build and train algorithms for extracting actionable usability issues, but raise serious concerns about the practical future prospects for supplementing traditional evaluation methods with automated extraction algorithms.},

In studies with older populations (ill) health has been used as a proxy measure for quality of life (QoL). We have developed a needs satisfaction measure of QoL in early old age. Our measure has four ontologically grounded domains: control, autonomy, pleasure, and self-realization. The measure was piloted with focus groups, a self-completion pilot, and cognitive interview testing. This produced a 22-item scale that was included in a postal questionnaire and sent to 286 people aged 65–75 years. A 92\% response rate was achieved. The scale was reduced to 19 items on the basis of statistical analysis. The domains have Cronbach’s alphas between 0.6 and 0.8. Correlations between the four domains range from 0.4 to 0.7. A second order factor analysis revealed a single latent QoL factor. The scores for the 19-item scale are well distributed along the range although they exhibit a slight negative skew. Concurrent validity was assessed using the Life Satisfaction Index—well being. A strong and positive association was found between the two scales (r ¼ 0.6, p ¼ 0.01). The CASP-19 appears to be a useful scale for measuring QoL in older people.},

The aim of this study thus was to investigate the use of online social networks and its associations with university students' physiological, psychological and social health. Data results were obtained from 422 respondents using a questionnaire adapted from the "World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF)" questionnaire. Apart from WHOQOL BREF survey tool, students were asked to provide the data for demographic characteristics and the use of online social networks. The study results found that the majority of the students participated in the Facebook (98\%, n=417) and nearly half of the students spent 2 -3 hours daily on the online social networking sites (49\%, n=208). The students' participation of online social networks was significantly associated with the general health of students (r=0.26, p{\textless}0.05) and psychological health (r=0.25, p{\textless}0.05). However, the findings reported that online social networks did not affect the user's social health including satisfaction with social life, personal relationship and social supports. Overall the study results indicated that the frequent use of online social networks had improved both physiology and psychology health among the users. Yet, the use of online social networks did not encourage social supports to the university students.},

Embeddings offer distributional features about words. We study a conceptually simple classiﬁcation model by exploiting multiprototype word embeddings based on text classes. The key assumption is that words exhibit different distributional characteristics under different text classes. Based on this assumption, we train multiprototype distributional word representations for different text classes. Given a new document, its text class is predicted by maximizing the probabilities of embedding vectors of its words under the class. In two standard classiﬁcation benchmark datasets, one is balance and the other is imbalance, our model outperforms state-of-the-art systems, on both accuracy and macro-average F-1 score.},

We achieved feature reduction by loosely clustering similar features using graph search techniques. Similarity thresholds above 0.5 were used in our method to pair and cluster the features. Finally, we utilized Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifier to evaluate the effect of our method. Four datasets with dimensions up to 100,000 feature size and 400,000 document size were used to evaluate the result of our method. The result showed that around 4-10\% feature reduction was achieved with up to 1-4\% improvement of classification accuracy in terms of different datasets and classifiers. Meanwhile, we also succeeded in improving feature reduction and classification accuracy by combining our method with other classic feature reduction techniques such as chi-square and mutual information.},

Word2vec offers a unique perspective to the text mining community. By converting words and phrases into a vector representation, word2vec takes an entirely new approach on text classification. Based on the assumption that word2vec brings extra semantic features that helps in text classification, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of word2vec by showing that tf-idf and word2vec combined can outperform tf-idf because word2vec provides complementary features (e.g. semantics that tf-idf can't capture) to tf-idf. Our results show that the combination of word2vec weighted by tf-idf and tf-idf does not outperform tf-idf consistently. It is consistent enough to say the combination of the two can outperform either individually.},

However, its performance depends not only on its features but also on data preprocessing and model tuning. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the efficiency of more Support Vector Machine models using both TF-IDF approach and Word2Vec and Doc2Vec neural networks for text data representation. Besides the data vectorization process, I try to enhance the models’ efficiency by identifying which kind of kernel fits better the data or if it is just better to opt for the linear case. My results prove that for the “Reuters 21578” dataset, nonlinear Support Vector Machine is more efficient when the conversion of text data into numerical attributes is realized using Word2Vec models instead of TF-IDF and Doc2Vec representations. When it is considered that data meet linear separability requirements, TF-IDF representation outperforms all other options. Surprisingly, Doc2Vec models have the lowest performance and only in terms of computational cost they provide satisfactory results. This paper proves that while Word2Vec models are truly efficient for text data representation, Doc2Vec neural networks are unable to exceed even TF-IDF index representation. This evidence contradicts the common idea according to which Doc2Vec models should provide a better insight into the training data domain than Word2Vec models and certainly than the TF-IDF index.},

Large datasets such as World Health Organization (WHO) statistics are collected less than once per year, whereas social network platforms, such as Twitter, offer the opportunity for real-time analysis of expressed mood. Such patterns are valuable to the mental health research community, to help understand the periods and locations of greatest demand and unmet need. We describe the “We Feel” system for analyzing global and regional variations in emotional expression, and report the results of validation against known patterns of variation in mood. 2.73 × 109 emotional tweets were collected over a 12-week period, and automatically annotated for emotion, geographic location, and gender. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data illustrated a dominant in-phase pattern across all emotions, modulated by antiphase patterns for “positive” and “negative” emotions. The ﬁrst three principal components accounted for over 90\% of the variation in the data. PCA was also used to remove the dominant diurnal and weekly variations allowing identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant events within the data, with z-scores showing expression of emotions over 80 standard deviations from the mean. We also correlate emotional expression with WHO data at a national level and although no correlations were observed for the burden of depression, the burden of anxiety and suicide rates appeared to correlate with expression of particular emotions.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying word embeddings to expand the terminology of dietary supplements (DS) using over 26 million clinical notes.
Methods: Word embedding models (ie, word2vec and GloVe) trained on clinical notes were used to predeﬁne a list of top 40 semantically related terms for each of 14 commonly used DS. Each list was further evaluated by experts to generate semantically similar terms. We investigated the effect of corpus size and other settings (ie, vector size and window size) as well as the 2 word embedding models on performance for DS term expansion. We compared the number of clinical notes (and patients they represent) that were retrieved using the word embedding expanded terms to both the baseline terms and external DS sources expanded terms.
Results: Using the word embedding models trained on clinical notes, we could identify 1–12 semantically similar terms for each DS. Using the word embedding expanded terms, we were able to retrieve averagely 8.39\% more clinical notes and 11.68\% more patients for each DS compared with 2 sets of terms. The increasing corpus size results in more misspellings, but not more semantic variants and brand names. Word2vec model is also found more capable of detecting semantically similar terms than GloVe.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the utility of word embeddings on clinical notes for terminology expansion on 14 DS. We propose that this method can be potentially applied to create a DS vocabulary for downstream applications, such as information extraction.},

Methods: A sample of 215 elementary children participated in a weekly 30-min DDR program. Children’s situational motivation toward DDR (intrinsic motivation, identiﬁed regulation, external regulation, and amotivation) was measured, followed by the measurement of their accelerometer-determined moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) in DDR. Children then reported their PA enjoyment.
Results: Only intrinsic motivation was positively related with children’s MVPA in DDR and PA enjoyment. However, other motivational beliefs were not signiﬁcantly related to MVPA and PA enjoyment. Regression analyses further suggested intrinsic motivation was the signiﬁcant predictor for MVPA and PA enjoyment.
Conclusion: Children who experienced fun and learned new things when playing DDR reached high PA levels in DDR, as well as developed generalized feeling states of enjoyment.

The method is based on two stages: we start by extracting possibly relevant tweets using a set of specially crafted regular expressions, and then classify these initial messages using machine learning methods. Furthermore, we selected relevant features to improve the results and the execution times. To test the method, we considered four health states or conditions, namely flu, depression, pregnancy and eating disorders, and two locations, Portugal and Spain. We present the results obtained and demonstrate that the detection results and the performance of the method are improved after feature selection. The results are promising, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7 and 0.9, and f-measure values around 0.8 and 0.9. This fact indicates that such approach provides a feasible solution for measuring and tracking the evolution of health states within the society.},

	abstract = {Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an important step in biomedical text mining, which is responsible for assigning an unequivocal concept to an ambiguous term, improving the accuracy of biomedical information extraction systems. In this work we followed supervised and knowledge-based disambiguation approaches, with the best results obtained by supervised means. In the supervised method we used bag-of-words as local features, and word embeddings as global features. In the knowledge-based method we combined word embeddings, concept textual definitions extracted from the UMLS database, and concept association values calculated from the MeSH co-occurrence counts from MEDLINE articles. Also, in the knowledge-based method, we tested different word embedding averaging functions to calculate the surrounding context vectors, with the goal to give more importance to closest words of the ambiguous term. The MSH WSD dataset, the most common dataset used for evaluating biomedical concept disambiguation, was used to evaluate our methods. We obtained a top accuracy of 95.6 \% by supervised means, while the best knowledge-based accuracy was 87.4 \%. Our results show that word embedding models improved the disambiguation accuracy, proving to be a powerful resource in the WSD task.},

Nevertheless, this process has also brought new challenges to the medical environment since the facilitated replication of information (e.g. using copy-paste) has resulted in less concise and sometimes incorrect information, which hinders the understandability of this data and can compromise the quality of medical decisions drawn from it. Due to the high volume and redundancy in medical data, it is imperative to develop solutions that can condense information whilst retaining its value, with a possible methodology involving the assessment of the semantic similarity between clinical text excerpts.},

In recent years, various solutions have been implemented to tackle this problem. However, limitations regarding system characteristics, customization and usability still hinder their wider application outside text mining research.
Results: We present Gimli, an open-source, state-of-the-art tool for automatic recognition of biomedical names. Gimli includes an extended set of implemented and user-selectable features, such as orthographic, morphological, linguistic-based, conjunctions and dictionary-based. A simple and fast method to combine diﬀerent trained models is also provided. Gimli achieves an F-measure of 87.17\% on GENETAG and 72.23\% on JNLPBA corpus, signiﬁcantly outperforming existing open-source solutions.
Conclusions: Gimli is an oﬀ-the-shelf, ready to use tool for named-entity recognition, providing trained and optimized models for recognition of biomedical entities from scientiﬁc text. It can be used as a command line tool, oﬀering full functionality, including training of new models and customization of the feature set and model parameters through a conﬁguration ﬁle. Advanced users can integrate Gimli in their text mining workﬂows through the provided library, and extend or adapt its functionalities. Based on the underlying system characteristics and functionality, both for ﬁnal users and developers, and on the reported performance results, we believe that Gimli is a state-of-the-art solution for biomedical NER, contributing to faster and better research in the ﬁeld.

The framework is then validated via a series of qualitative, longitudinal studies. In each study, genuine consumers searched online for information and advice concerning their speciﬁc health issue. They engaged in free searching and were directed towards sites previously reviewed using the framework. Thematic analysis of the group discussions provided support for the framework and for the staged model of trust wherein design appeal predicted rejection (mistrust) and credibility of information and personalization of content predicted selection (trust) of advice sites. The results are discussed in terms of the merits of the framework, its limitations and directions for future work.},

Yet there has been little empirical investigation of what game experiences players consider emotionally moving, their causes and effects, and whether players ﬁnd these experiences rewarding at all. We analyzed 121 players’ accounts of emotionally moving game experiences in terms of the feelings and thoughts they evoked, different PX constructs, as well as game-related and personal factors contributing to these. We found that most players enjoyed and appreciated experiencing negatively valenced emotions, such as sadness. Emotions were evoked by a variety of interactive and non-interactive game aspects, such as in-game loss, character attachment and (lack of) agency, but also personal memories, and were often accompanied by (self-)reﬂection. Our ﬁndings highlight the potential of games to provide emotionally rewarding and thought-provoking experiences, as well as outline opportunities for future research and design of such experiences. They also showcase that negative affect may contribute to enjoyment, thereby extending our notion of positive player experience.},

	abstract = {Affective lexicon is one of the most important resource in affective computing for text. Manually constructed affective lexicons have limited scale and thus only have limited use in practical systems. In this work, we propose a regression-based method to automatically infer multi-dimensional affective representation of words via their word embedding based on a set of seed words. This method can make use of the rich semantic meanings obtained from word embedding to extract meanings in some speciﬁc semantic space. This is based on the assumption that different features in word embedding contribute differently to a particular affective dimension and a particular feature in word embedding contributes differently to different affective dimensions. Evaluation on various affective lexicons shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all the lexicons under different evaluation metrics with large margins. We also explore different regression models and conclude that the Ridge regression model, the Bayesian Ridge regression model and Support Vector Regression with linear kernel are the most suitable models. Comparing to other state-of-the-art methods, our method also has computation advantage. Experiments on a sentiment analysis task show that the lexicons extended by our method achieve better results than publicly available sentiment lexicons on eight sentiment corpora. The extended lexicons are publicly available for access.},

Three supplementary dimensions spring from the observation that experiences apparently have become especially valuable phenomena in Western societies. The 10 dimensions are tried out in a field study at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Germany with the purpose to study their applicability in the evaluation of interactive sound archives. 29 walk-alongs were carried out with 58 museums visitors. Our analysis showed that it was possible to identify the 10 experience dimensions in the study material. Some dimensions were expressed more frequently than others. The distribution of expressed dimensions and the content of the user comments provided a clear picture of how the two sound archives differed in respect to the experiential qualities.},

It has motivated many universities around the world to invest in the development and implementation of learning analytics dashboards (LADs). These dashboards commonly make use of interactive visualisation widgets to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about the learning process. A common operation in analytical dashboards is a ‘drill-down’, which in an educational setting allows users to explore the behaviour of sub-populations of learners by progressively adding filters. Nevertheless, drill-down challenges exist, which hamper the most effective use of the data, especially by users without a formal background in data analysis. Accordingly, in this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach that recommends insightful drill-downs to LAD users. We present results from an application of our proposed approach using an existing LAD. A set of insightful drill-down criteria from a course with 875 students are explored and discussed.},

In an effort to fill some of those gaps, this paper explores an amateur game design community with visible ongoing documentation practices. This research is meant to help establish cognates to professional game design practices in the service of building out the broader game design ecology. This discursive case study presents a way into a practice often closed off from technical communication scholars, UX specialists, and instructors attempting to train students in the daily work and technical communication practices of game design.},

Thus, automated approaches have been proposed in literature with the aim of reducing the eﬀort required for analyzing feedback contained in user reviews via automatic classiﬁcation/prioritization according to speciﬁc topics. In this paper, we introduce SURF (Summarizer of User Reviews Feedback), a novel approach to condense the enormous amount of information that developers of popular apps have to manage due to user feedback received on a daily basis. SURF relies on a conceptual model for capturing user needs useful for developers performing maintenance and evolution tasks. Then it uses sophisticated summarisation techniques for summarizing thousands of reviews and generating an interactive, structured and condensed agenda of recommended software changes. We performed an end-to-end evaluation of SURF on user reviews of 17 mobile apps (5 of them developed by Sony Mobile), involving 23 developers and researchers in total. Results demonstrate high accuracy of SURF in summarizing reviews and the usefulness of the recommended changes. In evaluating our approach we found that SURF helps developers in better understanding user needs, substantially reducing the time required by developers compared to manually analyzing user (change) requests and planning future software changes.},

In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager’s architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization speciﬁcation tool, we ﬁnd that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question-answering.},

	abstract = {Credit card fraud analysis is almost entirely automated. However, there may be occasions when a human analyst is required to intervene. In this paper, we consider situations in which a transaction triggers an automated alert but not sufﬁciently to allow automated response. On such occasions, automated analysis makes a recommendation as to the fraud pattern that has been identiﬁed and the human analyst decides, if this recommendation is correct and what action to take. In order to support the analyst, a “dashboard” can be used to display information that is relevant to the fraud pattern. Thus, a computer could analyze transaction data, deﬁne this as a known fraud pattern, and then present the analyst with a dashboard to illustrate how the transaction might ﬁt the pattern. We explore the efﬁciency with which people respond to the computer’s recommendation, and whether computer conﬁdence has an impact on this response. We deﬁne efﬁciency in terms of information search: the user will either have the relevant information on screen or will need to drill-into a dashboard (i.e., open additional windows for information). The results show that participants adapt their decision making to the conﬁdence of the automated support, and, although they drill-down even when not required, are efﬁcient in terms of time spent looking at relevant information.},

	abstract = {Increasing amount of data the organizations worldwide have at their disposal lead to the need to structure, organize and present the information obtained from it. That is because, in today’s rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy eﬃciency has become a greater ﬁeld of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To ﬁll this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboard’s goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most proﬁt. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy eﬃciency, we have chosen that to be our dashboard’s goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system. This paper presents the design and the architecture of our proposed solution synergizing the notions from complexity theory, software architecture and user experience (UX) design.},

With the increase in the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of data on students, manual navigation and sense-making of such multi-dimensional data have become challenging. This paper proposes an analytical approach to assist LAD users with navigating the large set of possible drill-down actions to identify insights about learning behaviours of the sub-cohorts. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that it takes a process mining lens to examine and compare students’ learning behaviours. The process oriented approach considers the ﬂow and frequency of the sequences of performed learning activities, which is increasingly recognised as essential for understanding and optimising learning. We present results from an application of our approach in an existing LAD using a course with 875 students, with high demographic and educational diversity. We demonstrate the insights the approach enables, exploring how the learning behaviour of an identiﬁed sub-cohort diﬀers from the remaining students and how the derived insights can be used by instructors.},

	abstract = {With the internet taking over many aspects of our lives including the way commercial practices are handled, many business owners are taking what has been posted about them in the forms of online reviews very seriously. While most e-business data visualisation tools focus on website analytics and customer behaviors to determine what customers want and what product or service needs improvement, many dismiss the importance of online reviews, especially the ability to determine if a review should be considered valuable or not. One of the problems of efficiently understanding online reviews is the reader not having enough cognitive strength and working memory to decide if the reviews should be taken seriously or not, and at the same time, understand what the review is about. This paper proposes a novel model to automatically mine online reviews from certain websites, analyses them using decisiontree machine learning and n-grams, and then display a visualisations to highlight how true a review is to be considered. To achieve this, several stages take place in the visualisation system’s framework, including retrieving and processing the data, and creating the visualisation. In this study, we focus on reducing cognitive overload by performing some pilot usability studies so that business owners can make better informed decisions.},

We employ the cotraining framework in the proposed algorithm. Features are split into text view features and non-text view features. Two Random Forest (RF) classifiers are trained with the common labeled data on the two views of features separately. Then for each specific event, they collaboratively and periodically train together to boost the classification performance. At last, we propose a “river” graph to visualize the intensity and evolvement of sentiment on an event, which demonstrates the intensity by both color gradient and opinion labels, and the ups and downs of confronting opinions by the river flow. Comparing with the well-known sentiment classifiers, our algorithm achieves consistent increases in accuracy on the tweet events from TREC 2011 Microblogging and our database. The visualization helps people recognize turning and bursting patterns, and predict sentiment trend in an intuitive way.},

	abstract = {To improve care coordination, forestall emergencies, and save costs, there is a growing movement to have patients at home habitually collect and provide data about their health status and related experiences to health care providers. One aspect of this movement involves the recurring use of reliable and valid questionnaires to collect and share patient reported outcomes (PRO) data. However, studies indicate that health care providers have a host of legitimate concerns about the systematic and routine collection, sharing, and use of PRO data. To explore these provider-specific concerns further, we developed a configurable prototype software application for use by providers and their patients called the PRO Data Dashboard (PDD). Using the PDD along with several written clinical case scenarios, we conducted focus groups with a diverse group of oncology care providers to generate findings relevant to the design, configuration, and use of PRO-based tools. We organized our findings into three categories: scope of use of PRO tools, configuration of PRO tools, and clinician user experience. We conclude that providers require fine-grained control over the configuration of PRO data collection and sharing features in e-Health applications.},

The personality traits of a player is identified by applying a text mining process on textual contents related to the player. The same process is also applied on the comments of the games to identified the personality traits of games. Recommendation is then performed based on the similarity between the traits of the user and the game. We performed experiments on 63 players and 2050 games and obtained promising results which may demonstrate the plausibility of personality-based recommender systems.},

In this paper, we propose to use two text mining techniques which are applied to textual data to infer contextual information automatically: named entities recognition and topic hierarchies. We evaluate the proposed technique in four context-aware recommender systems. The empirical results demonstrate that by using named entities and topic hierarchies we can provide better recommendations.},

Yet, recent studies have identified various forms of bias in language-based models, raising concerns about the risk of propagating social biases against certain groups based on sociodemographic factors (e.g., gender, race, geography). In this study, we contribute a systematic examination of the application of language models to study discourse on aging. We analyze the treatment of age-related terms across 15 sentiment analysis models and 10 widely-used GloVe word embeddings and attempt to alleviate bias through a method of processing model training data. Our results demonstrate that significant age bias is encoded in the outputs of many sentiment analysis algorithms and word embeddings. We discuss the models’ characteristics in relation to output bias and how these models might be best incorporated into research.},

	abstract = {For many applications that require semantic understanding of short texts, inferring discriminative and coherent latent topics from short texts is a critical and fundamental task. Conventional topic models largely rely on word co-occurrences to derive topics from a collection of documents. However, due to the length of each document, short texts are much more sparse in terms of word co-occurrences. Data sparsity therefore becomes a bottleneck for conventional topic models to achieve good results on short texts. On the other hand, when a human being interprets a piece of short text, the understanding is not solely based on its content words, but also her background knowledge (e.g., semantically related words). The recent advances in word embedding offer effective learning of word semantic relations from a large corpus. Exploiting such auxiliary word embeddings to enrich topic modeling for short texts is the main focus of this paper. To this end, we propose a simple, fast, and effective topic model for short texts, named GPU-DMM. Based on the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model, GPU-DMM promotes the semantically related words under the same topic during the sampling process by using the generalized Po´lya urn (GPU) model. In this sense, the background knowledge about word semantic relatedness learned from millions of external documents can be easily exploited to improve topic modeling for short texts. Through extensive experiments on two real-world short text collections in two languages, we show that GPU-DMM achieves comparable or better topic representations than state-of-the-art models, measured by topic coherence. The learned topic representation leads to the best accuracy in text classiﬁcation task, which is used as an indirect evaluation.},

In fact, exploring semantic components of textual documents is challenging, and assigning a document to one single category may appear inadequate. This paper employs word embeddings techniques to proportion documents over categories via semantic vector operations. Word embeddings are useful in capturing word semantics. The proposed method ﬁrst prepares keyword collections for each category by identifying representative words from training set; calculates the semantic similarity between each new document and the word collections of each category; and analyzes the category distribution of the document using percentages. In the distribution, larger values indicate higher similarities between the category and document. The proposed method is evaluated by comparing categories yielding top values in the distribution of a document with its original category. Experimental results show that the proposed method can eﬃciently analyze the semantic components of news articles.},

The dynamic evolution of instances within a narrative text is a challenging task, where complex behavioral evolutions and other characteristics specific to the narrative text need to be inferred and interpreted. While starting from an existing approach to the learning of these models, we propose an alternative initialization procedure which seems to be especially suited for the case of narrative text. As a validation benchmark, we use the Harry Potter series of books as a challenging case study for such character trait evolution. A benchmark data set based on temporal word analogies related to the characters in the plot of the series is considered. The results are promising, and the empirical validation seems to support the working ideas behind this proposal.},

An algorithm for text sentiment analysis is proposed solve the problem of text containing semantics, syntax, sentiment and other information. It begins with the learning of original text-multi word embedding in the semantic, syntactic, and sentiment information, followed by proceeding the word embedding fusion. The improved convolution neural network is applied for sentiment analysis. Thus, it solves the problem that the word embedding contains monotonous text information. K-means text clustering is applied by dividing similar text into the same cluster, thus improving the classification accuracy. The application of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality not only extracts the principal component information, but also solves the problem of redundancy embedding and improves the computational performance of classification model. The experiment results show that the presented method has a significant improvement in the accuracy, recall rate and F value of the sentiment polarity analysis of the critical text in comparison with other fusion algorithms.},

	abstract = {Learned vector representations of words are useful tools for many information retrieval and natural language processing tasks due to their ability to capture lexical semantics. However, while many such tasks involve or even rely on named entities as central components, popular word embedding models have so far failed to include entities as ﬁrst-class citizens. While it seems intuitive that annotating named entities in the training corpus should result in more intelligent word features for downstream tasks, performance issues arise when popular embedding approaches are na¨ıvely applied to entity annotated corpora. Not only are the resulting entity embeddings less useful than expected, but one also ﬁnds that the performance of the non-entity word embeddings degrades in comparison to those trained on the raw, unannotated corpus. In this paper, we investigate approaches to jointly train word and entity embeddings on a large corpus with automatically annotated and linked entities. We discuss two distinct approaches to the generation of such embeddings, namely the training of state-of-the-art embeddings on rawtext and annotated versions of the corpus, as well as node embeddings of a co-occurrence graph representation of the annotated corpus. We compare the performance of annotated embeddings and classical word embeddings on a variety of word similarity, analogy, and clustering evaluation tasks, and investigate their performance in entity-speciﬁc tasks. Our ﬁndings show that it takes more than training popular word embedding models on an annotated corpus to create entity embeddings with acceptable performance on common test cases. Based on these results, we discuss how and when node embeddings of the co-occurrence graph representation of the text can restore the performance.},

We show through examples that the embedding of the algorithm in the user experience dramatically affects the value to the user of the recommender. We argue that evaluating the user experience of a recommender requires a broader set of measures than have been commonly used, and suggest additional measures that have proven effective. Based on our analysis of the state of the ﬁeld, we identify the most important open research problems, and outline key challenges slowing the advance of the state of the art, and in some cases limiting the relevance of research to real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Background: Engaging in physical activity contributes to healthy aging; however, adherence to exercise programs is often low among older adults. Technology-mediated dance systems, which can be used at home, and dance as a way of keeping physically active have been receiving attention as a means of not only enabling physical activity among older people but may also address key psychosocial factors that are amenable to change.
Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of technology-mediated dance interventions and their impact on psychosocial factors in older adults (aged 65 or older).
Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials from January 2000 to February 2017 using key search terms. Two independent reviewers screened articles using predetermined selection criteria. Risk of bias of selected articles was assessed in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines.
Results: From an overall 264 articles, six articles (ﬁve studies) were found, which assessed the impact of technology-mediated dance interventions on psychosocial factors in older adults. Studies’ quality ratings were low, with exception of one study that was considered of moderate quality. None of the studies considered psychosocial factors as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes assessed fear of falling, depression, and training enjoyment, but no study showed evidence of an effective impact on these variables. The metaanalysis revealed low quality evidence that there was little or no difference above that of the comparison groups for fear of falling (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.02, 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] -0.37 to 0.33; P = 0.91; ﬁve trials). Similarly, there was little or no difference on depression (SMD -0.06, 95\% CI -0.59 to 0.47; P = 0.83; three trials).
Conclusion: Existing evidence to support the effectiveness of technology-mediated dance interventions and their impact on psychosocial factors in older adults is weak and with a high risk for bias. The ﬁndings of this review may inform future, more rigorous research in the area.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental study exploring how to best guide users when playing RealDance, a next generation dancing game prototype. It uses four Nintendo Wii remotes, attached to the wrists and ankles, to create a 3D spatial interface utilizing the entire body to more closely mimic real dancing. Since RealDance requires a player to use both arms and legs, the player needs to know which of their four limbs to use, where they are expected to move, and when they are expected to move in the dance sequence. To understand the best way to present this information, we implemented three visual interface methods: Timeline, Motion Lines, and Beat Circles, that are based on existing rhythm video games but extended to support RealDance’s 3D interaction requirements.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.
Objective: This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.
Results: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games. Discussion: Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of ﬁctional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and ﬁndings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.
Conclusion: Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Although several excellent reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the effect of video game trainings as tools to enhance well-being, most of them speciﬁcally focused on the effects of digital games on brain plasticity or cognitive decline in children and seniors. On the contrary, only one meta-analysis results to be focused on the adult population, and it is restricted to examining the effects of training with a particular genre of games (action video games) on cognitive skills of healthy adults.
Objectives: This systematic review was aimed to identify research evidences about the impact on cognitive [i.e., processing and reaction times (RTs), memory, task-switching/multitasking, and mental spatial rotation] and emotional skills of video games training in the healthy adult population.
Methods: A multi-component analysis of variables related to the study, the video games, and the outcomes of the training was made on the basis of important previous works. Databases used in the search were PsycINFO, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), PubMed, and Scopus. The search string was: [(“Video Games” OR “Computer Games” OR “Interactive Gaming”)] AND [(“Cognition”) OR (“Cognitive”) OR (“Emotion”) OR (“Emotion Regulation”)] AND [“Training”].
Results: Thirty-ﬁve studies met the inclusion criteria and were further classiﬁed into the different analysis’ variables. The majority of the retrieved studies used commercial video games, and action games in particular, which resulted to be the most commonly used, closely followed by puzzle games. Effect sizes for training with video games on cognitive skills in general ranged from 0.06 to 3.43: from 0.141 to 3.43 for processing and RTs, 0.06 to 1.82 for memory, 0.54 to 1.91 for task switching/multitasking, and 0.3 to 3.2 for mental spatial rotation; regarding video games for the training of emotional skills, effect sizes ranged from 0.201 to 3.01.
Conclusion: Overall, ﬁndings give evidences of beneﬁts of video games training on cognitive and emotional skills in relation to the healthy adult population, especially on young adults. Efﬁcacy has been demonstrated not only for non-commercial video games or commercial brain-training programs, but for commercial video games as well.},

	abstract = {Self-Determination Theory (SDT), a major psychological theory of human motivation, has become increasingly popular in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on games and play. However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We ﬁnd that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.},

After arguing the technical issues of this new task, we focus on the central problem, factuality analysis, among others and propose a machine learning-based solution as well as the task definition itself. Our empirical evaluation indicates that our factuality analysis task is sufﬁciently well-deﬁned to achieve a high inter-annotator agreement and our Factorial CRF-based model considerably outperforms the baseline. We also present an application system, which currently stores over 50M experience instances extracted from 150M Japanese blog posts with semantic indices and is scheduled to start serving as an experience search engine for unrestricted users in October.},

The healthcare sector is no exception, with public health departments now capitalizing on the beneﬁts that social media oﬀers when delivering healthcare education and communication with citizens. Provincial Health Committees (PHCs) in China have begun to adopt the micro-video sharing platform, Tik Tok, to engage with local residents and communicate health-related information. This study investigates the status quo of oﬃcial Tik Tok accounts managed by PHCs in mainland China. In total, 31 PHC accounts were analyzed during August 2019, while the top 100 most liked micro-videos were examined using content analysis. Coding included three major aspects: Quantiﬁed Impact, Video Content, and Video Form. 45.2\% (n = 14) of PHCs had oﬃcial Tik Tok accounts. A limited number of accounts (n = 2) were yet to upload a micro-video, while most (n = 9) had uploaded their ﬁrst micro-video during 2019. For the top 100 most liked micro-videos, a sharp diﬀerence was observed in terms of number of Likes, Comments and Reposts. Videos containing cartoons or documentary-style content were most frequently watched by citizens. Similarly, content that promoted professional health or provided knowledge of diseases was frequently viewed. Content containing original music, formal mandarin language, subtitles, and which lasted less than 60 s, were most frequently followed. It is considered a missed opportunity that most PHCs struggle to take advantage of the Tik Tok platform, especially given its growing popularity and daily increase in account creation.},

The model is tested against 278 actual users of Tik Tok. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed for data analysis. The findings put entertainment value, social value, perceived usefulness, and time-flexibility under the spotlight, but the ease of use and celebrity attractiveness don’t support our hypotheses. We conclude that Tik Tok users' loyalty is strongly driven by satisfaction, which in turn is primarily driven by the perceived value and weaken by the time-flexibility.

This study aims to perform a primary evaluation of political communication on TikTok. We collect a set of US partisan Republican and Democratic videos to investigate how users communicated with each other about political issues. With the help of computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical tools, we illustrate that political communication on TikTok is much more interactive in comparison to other social media platforms, with users combining multiple information channels to spread their messages. We show that political communication takes place in the form of communication trees since users generate branches of responses to existing content. In terms of user demographics, we find that users belonging to both the US parties are young and behave similarly on the platform. However, Republican users generated more political content and their videos received more responses; on the other hand, Democratic users engaged significantly more in cross-partisan discussions.},

	abstract = {Academic research on digital games has been conducted for over 30 years. However, the abundance of disciplines conducting research on the topic makes it challenging for the interested to get a holistic and comprehensive account of past digital game studies. Yet, sophisticated text mining tools designed for structured science information resources, such as the ISI Web of Science or INSPEC, make it possible to conduct insightful literature studies that profile and visualize large knowledge domains. The primary aim of this paper is to profile the research literature from the ISI Web of Science on digital games. More than 2.100 studies between years 1986-2006 were found using a set of digital games-related search words. Secondly, the aim is to find out what are the current “hot” research topics and research trends of the near future. Our profiling study demonstrates that digital game research is indeed highly multidisciplinary, covering more than 170 subject categories of the ISI Web of Science. When combining these categories into larger areas of science, it was found that the three most prominent areas are the Social Sciences (including e.g. psychology and communication), the Health Sciences (e.g. experimental psychology, psychiatry and pediatrics), and Information and Communication Technologies and Mathematics (e.g. computer science theory and methods, software engineering). The fields of Engineering and Arts \& Humanities are also well represented in digital game research, although to a much lesser amount. The research in ICT (computer science, information systems etc.) seems to have grown the fastest in the last 10 years.},

They contain a wealth of information about the opinions and experiences of users, which can help better understand consumer decisions and improve user experience with products and services. Today, data scientists analyze reviews by developing rules and models to extract, aggregate, and understand information embedded in the review text. However, working with thousands of reviews, which are typically noisy incomplete text, can be daunting without proper tools. Here we ﬁrst contribute results from an interview study that we conducted with ﬁfteen data scientists who work with review text, providing insights into their practices and challenges. Results suggest data scientists need interactive systems for many review analysis tasks. In response we introduce Teddy, an interactive system that enables data scientists to quickly obtain insights from reviews and improve their extraction and modeling pipelines.},

Recently, new research approaches have been deﬁned in order to automatically extract such opinions from the Internet. They usually consider opinions to be expressed through adjectives, and make extensive use of either general dictionaries or experts to provide the relevant adjectives. Unfortunately, these approaches suﬀer from the following drawback: in a speciﬁc domain, a given adjective may either not exist or have a diﬀerent meaning from another domain. In this paper, we propose a new approach focusing on two steps. First, we automatically extract a learning dataset for a speciﬁc domain from the Internet. Secondly, from this learning set we extract the set of positive and negative adjectives relevant to the domain. The usefulness of our approach was demonstrated by experiments performed on real data.},

This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like Twitter. We present the results of machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distant supervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messages with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type of training data is abundantly available and can be obtained through automated means. We show that machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM) have accuracy above 80\% when trained with emoticon data. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons for distant supervised learning.},

We propose a novel probabilistic rating regression model to solve this new text mining problem in a general way. Empirical experiments on a hotel review data set show that the proposed latent rating regression model can eﬀectively solve the problem of LARA, and that the detailed analysis of opinions at the level of topical aspects enabled by the proposed model can support a wide range of application tasks, such as aspect opinion summarization, entity ranking based on aspect ratings, and analysis of reviewers rating behavior.},

A research paper recommender system would greatly help researchers to find the most desirable papers in their fields of endeavor. Due to the textual nature of papers, content information could be integrated into existed recommendation methods. In this paper, we proposed that by using topic model techniques to make topic analysis on research papers, we could introduce a thematic similarity measurement into a modified version of item-based recommendation approach. This novel recommendation method could considerable alleviate the cold start problem in research paper recommendation. Our experiment result shows that our approach could recommend highly relevant research papers.},

Recent studies analyzed this feedback and found that it includes information useful for app developers, such as user requirements, ideas for improvements, user sentiments about specific features, and descriptions of experiences with these features. However, for many apps, the amount of reviews is too large to be processed manually and their quality varies largely. The star ratings are given to the whole app and developers do not have a mean to analyze the feedback for the single features. In this paper we propose an automated approach that helps developers filter, aggregate, and analyze user reviews. We use natural language processing techniques to identify fine-grained app features in the reviews. We then extract the user sentiments about the identified features and give them a general score across all reviews. Finally, we use topic modeling techniques to group fine-grained features into more meaningful high-level features. We evaluated our approach with 7 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and compared its results with a manually, peer-conducted analysis of the reviews. On average, our approach has a precision of 0.59 and a recall of 0.51. The extracted features were coherent and relevant to requirements evolution tasks. Our approach can help app developers to systematically analyze user opinions about single features and filter irrelevant reviews.},

Such ideas span various topics, and in this paper we show that 23.3\% of them represent feature requests, i.e. comments through which users either suggest new features for an app or express preferences for the re-design of already existing features of an app. One of the challenges app developers face when trying to make use of such feedback is the massive amount of available reviews. This makes it difficult to identify specific topics and recurring trends across reviews. Through this work, we aim to support such processes by designing MARA (Mobile App Review Analyzer), a prototype for automatic retrieval of mobile app feature requests from online reviews. The design of the prototype is a) informed by an investigation of the ways users express feature requests through reviews, b) developed around a set of pre-defined linguistic rules, and c) evaluated on a large sample of online reviews. The results of the evaluation were further analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation for identifying common topics across feature requests, and the results of this analysis are reported in this paper.},

To facilitate mobile app developers discover the most “informative” user reviews from a large and rapidly increasing pool of user reviews, we present “AR-Miner” — a novel computational framework for App Review Mining, which performs comprehensive analytics from raw user reviews by (i) ﬁrst extracting informative user reviews by ﬁltering noisy and irrelevant ones, (ii) then grouping the informative reviews automatically using topic modeling, (iii) further prioritizing the informative reviews by an eﬀective review ranking scheme, (iv) and ﬁnally presenting the groups of most “informative” reviews via an intuitive visualization approach.

	abstract = {Background: Sarcopenia, defined as the age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength, can be effectively mitigated through resistance-based physical activity. With compliance at approximately 40\% for home-based exercise prescriptions, implementing a remote sensing system would help patients and clinicians to better understand treatment progress and increase compliance. The inclusion of end users in the development of mobile apps for remote-sensing systems can ensure that they are both user friendly and facilitate compliance. With advancements in natural language processing (NLP), there is potential for these methods to be used with data collected through the user-centered design process.
Objective: This study aims to develop a mobile app for a novel device through a user-centered design process with both older adults and clinicians while exploring whether data collected through this process can be used in NLP and sentiment analysis
Methods: Through a user-centered design process, we conducted semistructured interviews during the development of a geriatric-friendly Bluetooth-connected resistance exercise band app. We interviewed patients and clinicians at weeks 0, 5, and 10 of the app development. Each semistructured interview consisted of heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, and observations. We used the Bing sentiment library for a sentiment analysis of interview transcripts and then applied NLP-based latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify differences and similarities in patient and clinician participant interviews. Sentiment was defined as the sum of positive and negative words (each word with a +1 or −1 value). To assess utility, we used quantitative assessment questionnaires—System Usability Scale (SUS) and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use (USE). Finally, we used multivariate linear models—adjusting for age, sex, subject group (clinician vs patient), and development—to explore the association between sentiment analysis and SUS and USE outcomes.
Results: The mean age of the 22 participants was 68 (SD 14) years, and 17 (77\%) were female. The overall mean SUS and USE scores were 66.4 (SD 13.6) and 41.3 (SD 15.2), respectively. Both patients and clinicians provided valuable insights into the needs of older adults when designing and building an app. The mean positive-negative sentiment per sentence was 0.19 (SD 0.21) and 0.47 (SD 0.21) for patient and clinician interviews, respectively. We found a positive association with positive sentiment in an interview and SUS score (ß=1.38; 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.39; P=.01). There was no significant association between sentiment and the USE score. The LDA analysis found no overlap between patients and clinicians in the 8 identified topics.
Conclusions: Involving patients and clinicians allowed us to design and build an app that is user friendly for older adults while supporting compliance. This is the first analysis using NLP and usability questionnaires in the quantification of user-centered design of technology for older adults.},

It also includes the classi cation of the opinion expression into positive or negative and the classi cation of its intensity into high, medium and low. Our method relies on wide range of features which are used in the literature like n-grams, morphological, stylistic features, etc. In addition, we propose new features inspired from contextual, semantic information and others speci c for Arabic language. In the same context, we try to have a good contribution in opinion mining in Arabic by proposing to use Conditional Random Fields as a discriminative model. We carry out many experiments by combining at the same time di erent set of features to nd the best combination that yield the best results.

We are interested in opinion mining of usergenerated content on drugs/medication. We present in this paper the creation of our lexical resources and their adaptation to the medical domain. We ﬁrst describe the creation of a general lexicon, containing opinion words from the general domain and their polarity. Then we present the creation of a medical opinion lexicon, based on a corpus of drug reviews. We show that some words have a diﬀerent polarity in the general domain and in the medical one. Some words considered generally as neutral are opinionated in medical texts. We ﬁnally evaluate the lexicons and show with a simple algorithm that using our general lexicon gives better results than other well-known ones on our corpus and that adding the domain lexicon improves them as well.},

Visualisation is proposed as a communication enabler at the top of the framework to overcome the comprehensibility barrier between data science and engineering design models. The framework is implemented in the case study of a construction equipment encompassing the analysis of operational machine data and the experimentation of suitable visualisation techniques. Ultimately, a list of challenges for the implementation of data-driven design is presented, and the capability of the framework to support the transition toward data-driven design is discussed in relation to the emergence of product-service systems solutions.},

This has motivated us to carry out a number of enhancements, including, for instance, enriching the given lexicon with domain specific terms, formulating specific rules for negation and amplifiers. Automatic pruning of some of the lexicon terms has led to a significant improvement in performance. As our final system achieved a very good performance, our work should be of interest to others working on domain specific solutions for languages where ready-made solutions are not available.},

Using our framework we perform two large-scale empirical studies to quantify the extent to which sentiment varies across time and between communities. We induce and release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and community-speciﬁc sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons show that more than 5\% of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-speciﬁc lexicons highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.},

There is also an interactive semantic search interface (Prospector), where users can save, refine, and analyse the results of semantic search queries over time. Practical use of the framework is exemplified through three case studies: a general scenario analysing tweets from UK politicians and the public’s response to them in the run up to the 2015 UK general election, an investigation of attitudes towards climate change expressed by these politicians and the public, via their engagement with environmental topics, and an analysis of public tweets leading up to the UK’s referendum on leaving the EU (Brexit) in 2016.

In this article we evaluate the impact that psycholinguistic patterns can have on a standard machine learning approach for classifying depressed users based on their writings in an online public forum. We combine psycholinguistic features in a rule-based estimator and we evaluate their impact on this classiﬁcation problem, along with three other standard classiﬁers. Our results on the Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagnosis dataset outperform some previously reported works on the same dataset.

	abstract = {Understanding user experience (UX) becomes more important in a market-driven design paradigm because it helps designers uncover significant factors, such as user’s preference, usage context, product features, as well as their interrelations. Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about users’ experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won’t easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified. This study explores the feasibility to discover valuable UX data as well as their relations automatically for product design and business strategic plan by analyzing a large volume of customer online data.},

We mainly focus on finding out which method is appropriate to detect sentiments from forum discussion posts. In order to conduct our experiments, we use the apache-hadoop framework with its lexicon-based sentiment prediction algorithm and Stanford coreNLP library with the Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) model. The lexicon- based uses sentiment dictionary containing words annotated with sentiment labels and other basic lexical features, and the later one is trained on Sentiment Treebank with 215,154 phrases, labeled using Amazon Turk. Our overall performance evaluation shows that RNTN outperforms the lexicon-based by 9.88\% accuracy on variable length positive, negative, and neutral comments. How- ever, the lexicon-based shows better performance on classifying positive comments. We also found out that the F1-score values of the Lexicon-based is greater by 0.16 from the RNTN.},

Obtaining information from these data is not an easy task. It requires different techniques to extract information. Text mining is one of them. Text mining is the process of extracting information, pattern or knowledge from different text documents available on different resources. Every day million bytes data are added in exiting data. Most of data stored in text documents which are unstructured data and cannot be used for any processing to extract useful information. So different techniques such as classification, clustering and information extraction are applied for this purpose. There is a number of text categorization techniques are developed. Some of them are based on supervised and some of them unsupervised manner of document arrangement. In this paper focus is based on Text Mining, different text mining techniques and its application.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare energy expenditure rates in children playing the physically active video games, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and Nintendo's Wii Sports in relation to treadmill walking.
METHODS: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls (ages 10-13 years; BMI at 3-98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming.
RESULTS: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2- to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play (lowest step rate) than during walking (highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efforts to achieve population-wide increases in walking and similar moderate-intensity physical activities potentially can be enhanced through relevant applications of state-of-the-art interactive communication technologies. Yet few systematic efforts to evaluate the efficacy of hand-held computers and similar devices for enhancing physical activity levels have occurred. The purpose of this first-generation study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD+) physical activity levels over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults relative to a standard information control arm.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled 8-week experiment. Data were collected in 2005 and analyzed in 2006-2007.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-based study of 37 healthy, initially underactive adults aged 50 years and older who were randomized and completed the 8-week study (intervention=19, control=18).
INTERVENTION: Participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their physical activity levels twice per day and provide daily and weekly individualized feedback, goal setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate written physical activity educational materials.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Physical activity was assessed via the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater 8-week mean estimated caloric expenditure levels and minutes per week in MOD+ activity (p{\textless}0.04). Satisfaction with the PDA was reasonably high in this largely PDA-naive sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this first-generation study indicate that hand-held computers may be effective tools for increasing initial physical activity levels among underactive adults.},

However, a variety of researchers have explored mixed-initiative clustering methods which allow a user to interact with and advise the clustering algorithm. This mixed-initiative approach is especially attractive for text clustering tasks where the user is trying to organize a corpus of documents into clusters for some particular purpose (e.g., clustering their email into folders that reﬂect various activities in which they are involved). This paper introduces a new approach to mixed-initiative clustering that handles several natural types of user feedback. We ﬁrst introduce a new probabilistic generative model for text clustering (the SpeClustering model) and show that it outperforms the commonly used mixture of multinomials clustering model, even when used in fully autonomous mode with no user input. We then describe how to incorporate four distinct types of user feedback into the clustering algorithm, and provide experimental evidence showing substantial improvements in text clustering when this user feedback is incorporated.},

Previously, we found that users were willing to provide a generous amount of rich feedback to machine learning systems, and that the types of some of this rich feedback seem promising for assimilation by machine learning algorithms. Following up on those findings, we ran an experiment to assess the viability of incorporating real-time keyword-based feedback in initial training phases when data is limited. We found that rich feedback improved accuracy but an initial unstable period often caused large fluctuations in classifier behavior. Participants were able to give feedback by relying heavily on system communication in order to respond to changes. The results show that in order to benefit from the user’s knowledge, machine learning systems must be able to absorb keyword-based rich feedback in a graceful manner and provide clear explanations of their predictions.},

If this resource—the users themselves—could somehow work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the accuracy of learning systems could be improved and the users’ understanding and trust of the system could improve as well. We conducted a think-aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give. Users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions. We found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback. The kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features, feature combinations, relational features, and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm. The results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems, but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback.},

There has been a recent increase in the number of commercial text mining product and service oﬀerings, but successful or wide-spread deployments are rare, mainly due to a dependence on the expertise and skill of practitioners. Accordingly, there is a growing need for re-usable repositories for text mining. In this paper, we focus on dictionary-based text mining and its role in enabling practitioners in understanding and analyzing large text datasets. We motivate and deﬁne the problem of exploratory dictionary construction for capturing concepts of interest, and propose a framework for eﬃcient construction, tuning, and re-use of these dictionaries across datasets. The construction framework offers a range of interaction modes to the user to quickly build concept dictionaries over large datasets. We also show how to adapt one or more dictionaries across domains and tasks, thereby enabling reuse of knowledge and eﬀort in industrial practice. We present results and case studies on real-life CRM analytics datasets, where such repositories and tooling signiﬁcantly cut down practitioner time and eﬀort for dictionary-based text mining.},

	abstract = {The use of text mining and natural language processing can extend into the realm of knowledge acquisition and management for biomedical applications. In this paper, we describe how we implemented natural language processing and text mining techniques on the transcribed verbal descriptions from retinal experts of biomedical disease features. The feature-attribute pairs generated were then incorporated within a user interface for a collaborative ontology development tool. This tool, IDOCS, is being used in the biomedical domain to help retinal specialists reach a consensus on a common ontology for describing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We compare the use of traditional text mining and natural language processing techniques with that of a retinal specialist’s analysis and discuss how we might integrate these techniques for future biomedical ontology and user interface development.},

Nevertheless UX design presents some risks, such as providing users with experiences that they do not wish. Furthermore, UX methodologies lack prescriptive tools for guiding designers. This paper establishes a link between UX research and Affordance theory and postulates the concept of Experience Affordances. Affordances represent a first step toward the development of prescriptive methods and help preventing designer from imposing experiences to users. Thus, a framework for describing product experience in terms of affordances is exposed and discussed by analysing exemplary products. In concluding the paper, the implications of the framework are presented.},

People like to express themselves about some events, places, leader's decisions, policies, etc. and for this purpose; they use social media, blogs, review sites, news sites, and user's feedback portals and so on. The opinion mining is the way to extract and analyze the sentiment of people from their opinions automatically. This extracted information can be useful for manufacturers to analyze their products. In the last one and half decade, research communities, academia, and service industries are working rigorously on sentiment analysis, also known as, opinion mining, to extract and analyze public mood and views. Opinion mining confronts a number of challenges to analyze the public views, in this study the challenges are comprehensively identified and discussed. This paper focuses on the challenges in opinion mining of different levels, i.e. word level, sentence level, language-related challenges, and some general challenges. The study comprehensively discussed 37 challenges with concise examples, which help to present issues in text or opinion mining for further research. A section briefly present opinion mining tools for initiating starting point for novice researchers. The published literature is covering publications from 2004-2018.},

Mining is used on product reviews that are available on different blogs, web forums, and product review sites to evaluate opinions of customers. By doing so, new customers are able to find views of others about a product and can decide which product to buy by the help of opinion of customers already using the product. In addition comparison of same feature of products by different vendors is done. In this way companies can focus on improving the features of their product that are not popular among customers. This leads to overcome the requirements of marketing intelligence and product benchmarking in the production industry. In this paper we do a survey of papers and will summarize the issues and challenges of opinion mining that affect the results of opinion mining.},

For a boilerplate to be effective, one needs to check whether the boilerplate has been properly applied. This should preferably be done automatically, as manual checking of conformance to a boilerplate can be laborious and error prone. In this paper, we present insights into building an automatic solution for checking conformance to requirement boilerplates using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We present a generalizable method for casting requirement boilerplates into automated NLP pattern matchers and reflect on our practical experience implementing automated checkers for two well-known boilerplates in the RE community. We further highlight the use of NLP for identification of several problematic syntactic constructs in requirements which can lead to ambiguities.},

	title = {Improved recommendation based on collaborative tagging behaviors},
	abstract = {Considering the natural tendency of people to follow direct or indirect cues of other people's activities, collaborative filtering-based recommender systems often predict the utility of an item for a particular user according to previous ratings by other similar users. Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.},

	abstract = {Background: Sarcopenia, defined as the age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength, can be effectively mitigated through resistance-based physical activity. With compliance at approximately 40\% for home-based exercise prescriptions, implementing a remote sensing system would help patients and clinicians to better understand treatment progress and increase compliance. The inclusion of end users in the development of mobile apps for remote-sensing systems can ensure that they are both user friendly and facilitate compliance. With advancements in natural language processing (NLP), there is potential for these methods to be used with data collected through the user-centered design process.
Objective: This study aims to develop a mobile app for a novel device through a user-centered design process with both older adults and clinicians while exploring whether data collected through this process can be used in NLP and sentiment analysis
Methods: Through a user-centered design process, we conducted semistructured interviews during the development of a geriatric-friendly Bluetooth-connected resistance exercise band app. We interviewed patients and clinicians at weeks 0, 5, and 10 of the app development. Each semistructured interview consisted of heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, and observations. We used the Bing sentiment library for a sentiment analysis of interview transcripts and then applied NLP-based latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify differences and similarities in patient and clinician participant interviews. Sentiment was defined as the sum of positive and negative words (each word with a +1 or −1 value). To assess utility, we used quantitative assessment questionnaires—System Usability Scale (SUS) and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use (USE). Finally, we used multivariate linear models—adjusting for age, sex, subject group (clinician vs patient), and development—to explore the association between sentiment analysis and SUS and USE outcomes.
Results: The mean age of the 22 participants was 68 (SD 14) years, and 17 (77\%) were female. The overall mean SUS and USE scores were 66.4 (SD 13.6) and 41.3 (SD 15.2), respectively. Both patients and clinicians provided valuable insights into the needs of older adults when designing and building an app. The mean positive-negative sentiment per sentence was 0.19 (SD 0.21) and 0.47 (SD 0.21) for patient and clinician interviews, respectively. We found a positive association with positive sentiment in an interview and SUS score (ß=1.38; 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.39; P=.01). There was no significant association between sentiment and the USE score. The LDA analysis found no overlap between patients and clinicians in the 8 identified topics.
Conclusions: Involving patients and clinicians allowed us to design and build an app that is user friendly for older adults while supporting compliance. This is the first analysis using NLP and usability questionnaires in the quantification of user-centered design of technology for older adults.},

Two case studies were conducted to evaluate the usefulness of text mining techniques and Web 2.0 technologies for enhancing a large scale CBR system.

	abstract = {Background: 
Design processes such as human-centered design, which involve the end user throughout the product development and testing process, can be crucial in ensuring that the product meets the needs and capabilities of the user, particularly in terms of safety and user experience. The structured and iterative nature of human-centered design can often present a challenge when design teams are faced with the necessary, rapid, product development life cycles associated with the competitive connected health industry.

Objective:
We wanted to derive a structured methodology that followed the principles of human-centered design that would allow designers and developers to ensure that the needs of the user are taken into account throughout the design process, while maintaining a rapid pace of development. In this paper, we present the methodology and its rationale before outlining how it was applied to assess and enhance the usability, human factors, and user experience of a connected health system known as the Wireless Insole for Independent and Safe Elderly Living (WIISEL) system, a system designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring gait and balance parameters associated with fall risk.

Methods:
We derived a three-phase methodology. In Phase 1 we emphasized the construction of a use case document. This document can be used to detail the context of use of the system by utilizing storyboarding, paper prototypes, and mock-ups in conjunction with user interviews to gather insightful user feedback on different proposed concepts. In Phase 2 we emphasized the use of expert usability inspections such as heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs with small multidisciplinary groups to review the prototypes born out of the Phase 1 feedback. Finally, in Phase 3 we emphasized classical user testing with target end users, using various metrics to measure the user experience and improve the final prototypes.

Results:
We report a successful implementation of the methodology for the design and development of a system for detecting and predicting falls in older adults.

	abstract = {Mental health applications hold great promise as interventions for addressing common mental issues. Although many people with mental health issues use mobile app interventions, their adherence level remains low. Low engagement affects the effectiveness of mobile interventions. However, there is still a dearth of research to explain the reasons for low engagement. User experience and usability are two factors that determine the adoption and usage of apps. Analyzing user reviews of mobile apps for mental health issues reveals user experience and what features users liked and disliked in the apps and hence informs future app design and refinements. This research aims to analyze user reviews of publicly available mental health applications to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps, hence revealing why users are likely to cease using these applications. We mined reviews of 106 mental health apps retrieved from Apple’s App Store and Google Play and employed thematic analysis on 13,549 reviews. The review analysis shows that users placed more emphasis on the user interface and the user-friendliness of the app. Users also appreciated apps that present them with a variety of options, functionalities, and content that they can choose. Again, apps that offer adaptive functionalities that allow users to adapt some app features also received high ratings. In contrast, poor usability emerged as the most common reason for abandoning mental health apps. Other pitfalls include lack of a content variety, lack of personalization, lack of customer service and trust, and security and privacy issues.},

The Cochrane Library is a key source of evidence about the effect of interventions and aims to "promote the accessibility of systematic reviews to anyone wanting to make a decision about health care". We explored how health professionals found, used and experienced The Library, looking at facets of user experience including findability, usability, usefulness, credibility, desirability and value.
We carried out 32 one-hour usability tests on participants from Norway and the UK. Participants both browsed freely and attempted to perform individually tailored tasks while "thinking aloud". Sessions were recorded and viewed in real time by researchers. Transcriptions and videos were reviewed by one researcher and one designer. Findings reported here reflect issues receiving a high degree of saturation and that we judge to be critical to the user experience of evidence-based web sites, based on principles for usability heuristics, web guidelines and evidence-based practice.
Participants had much difficulty locating both the site and its contents. Non-native English speakers were at an extra disadvantage when retrieving relevant documents despite high levels of English-language skills. Many participants displayed feelings of ineptitude, alienation and frustration. Some made serious mistakes in correctly distinguishing between different information types, for instance reviews, review protocols, and individual studies. Although most expressed a high regard for the site's credibility, some later displayed a mistrust of the independence of the information. Others were overconfident, thinking everything on The Cochrane Library site shared the same level of quality approval.
Paradoxically, The Cochrane Library, established to support easy access to research evidence, has its own problems of accessibility. Health professionals' experiences of this and other evidence-based online resources can be improved by applying existing principles for web usability, prioritizing the development of simple search functionality, emitting "researcher" jargon, consistent marking of site ownership, and clear signposting of different document types and different content quality.},

	abstract = {Background: 
The process of documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) is known to be time consuming, inefficient, and cumbersome. The use of dictation coupled with manual transcription has become an increasingly common practice. In recent years, natural language processing (NLP)-enabled data capture has become a viable alternative for data entry. It enables the clinician to maintain control of the process and potentially reduce the documentation burden. The question remains how this NLP-enabled workflow will impact EHR usability and whether it can meet the structured data and other EHR requirements while enhancing the user's experience.

Objective:
The objective of this study is evaluate the comparative effectiveness of an NLP-enabled data capture method using dictation and data extraction from transcribed documents (NLP Entry) in terms of documentation time, documentation quality, and usability versus standard EHR keyboard-and-mouse data entry.

Methods:
This formative study investigated the results of using 4 combinations of NLP Entry and Standard Entry methods ("protocols") of EHR data capture. We compared a novel dictation-based protocol using MediSapien NLP (NLP-NLP) for structured data capture against a standard structured data capture protocol (Standard-Standard) as well as 2 novel hybrid protocols (NLP-Standard and Standard-NLP). The 31 participants included neurologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists. Participants generated 4 consultation or admission notes using 4 documentation protocols. We recorded the time on task, documentation quality (using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument, PDQI-9), and usability of the documentation processes.

Results:
A total of 118 notes were documented across the 3 subject areas. The NLP-NLP protocol required a median of 5.2 minutes per cardiology note, 7.3 minutes per nephrology note, and 8.5 minutes per neurology note compared with 16.9, 20.7, and 21.2 minutes, respectively, using the Standard-Standard protocol and 13.8, 21.3, and 18.7 minutes using the Standard-NLP protocol (1 of 2 hybrid methods). Using 8 out of 9 characteristics measured by the PDQI-9 instrument, the NLP-NLP protocol received a median quality score sum of 24.5; the Standard-Standard protocol received a median sum of 29; and the Standard-NLP protocol received a median sum of 29.5. The mean total score of the usability measure was 36.7 when the participants used the NLP-NLP protocol compared with 30.3 when they used the Standard-Standard protocol.

Conclusions:
In this study, the feasibility of an approach to EHR data capture involving the application of NLP to transcribed dictation was demonstrated. This novel dictation-based approach has the potential to reduce the time required for documentation and improve usability while maintaining documentation quality. Future research will evaluate the NLP-based EHR data capture approach in a clinical setting. It is reasonable to assert that EHRs will increasingly use NLP-enabled data entry tools such as MediSapien NLP because they hold promise for enhancing the documentation process and end-user experience.},

	abstract = {Set only allows unique value stored in it, as an inheritance of AbstractSet, HashSet also has the same feature. Before storing an element, HashSet will first check whether the element is already stored or not: if not, simply puts the element into the set; otherwise makes no change. Compared with other kinds of collection (for example, ArrayList or TreeSet), HashSet is the fastest one for checking whether an element already in the collection. Rather than calling the compare method of the datatype of the stored information, HashSet uses hash code as the unique identifier for each element in it. In case that two different elements have the same hash code, a normal comparison method is also integrated. If the hash code generation algorithm properly distributes the elements among the “buckets”, i.e., the hash codes of all the elements in HashSet are all distinct, then the basic operations (add, remove, contains, and size) have constant time performance O(1)17. For comparison, ArrayList performs O(n) in the operation of “contains” which is required for avoiding duplicates, and TreeSet performs O(log n) in “contains”. Thus, HashSet performs persistently well no matter what large size the data set increases to. Although ArrayList and TreeSet have some additional functions that HashSet doesn’t have, these functions are useless in removing duplicate IDs, which is our main purpose. In practice, HashSet is so fast in removing duplicates that the time used in the phase can be nearly ignored.},

In this work, we characterize the growth patterns of video popularity on the currently most popular video sharing application, namely YouTube. Using newly provided data by the application, we analyze how the popularity of individual videos evolves since the video’s upload time. Moreover, addressing a key aspect that has been mostly overlooked by previous work, we characterize the types of the referrers that most often attracted users to each video, aiming at shedding some light into the mechanisms (e.g., searching or external linking) that often drive users towards a video, and thus contribute to popularity growth. Our analyses are performed separately for three video datasets, namely, videos that appear in the YouTube top lists, videos removed from the system due to copyright violation, and videos selected according to random queries submitted to YouTube’s search engine. Our results show that popularity growth patterns depend on the video dataset. In particular, copyright protected videos tend to get most of their views much earlier in their lifetimes, often exhibiting a popularity growth characterized by a viral epidemic-like propagation process. In contrast, videos in the top lists tend to experience sudden signiﬁcant bursts of popularity. We also show that not only search but also other YouTube internal mechanisms play important roles to attract users to videos in all three datasets.},

Based on a large amount of data collected, we provide an in-depth study of YouTube and other similar UGC systems. In particular, we study the popularity life-cycle of videos, the intrinsic statistical properties of requests and their re- lationship with video age, and the level of content aliasing or of illegal content in the system. We also provide insights on the potential for more efficient UGC VoD systems (e.g. utilizing P2P techniques or making better use of caching). Finally, we discuss the opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos that are not reached today due to information filtering effects or other system scarcity distor- tions. Overall, we believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding UGC systems and can provide valuable information to ISPs, site administrators, and content owners with major commercial and technical implications.},

The proposed model treats words and entities in a given text as independent tokens, and outputs contextualized representations of them. Our model is trained using a new pretraining task based on the masked language model of BERT. The task involves predicting randomly masked words and entities in a large entity-annotated corpus retrieved from Wikipedia. We also propose an entity-aware self-attention mechanism that is an extension of the self-attention mechanism of the transformer, and considers the types of tokens (words or entities) when computing attention scores. The proposed model achieves impressive empirical performance on a wide range of entity-related tasks. In particular, it obtains state-of-the-art results on five well-known datasets: Open Entity (entity typing), TACRED (relation classification), CoNLL-2003 (named entity recognition), ReCoRD (cloze-style question answering), and SQuAD 1.1 (extractive question answering).

This paper focuses on this problem by the analysis of symbols called emotion tokens, including emotion symbols (e.g. emoticons and emoji ideograms). According to observation, these emotion tokens are commonly used. They directly express one’s emotion regardless of his language; hence become a useful signal for sentiment analysis on multilingual tweets.

The emojis can express more detailed information beyond text information, and their usage can improve interlocutors' communication efficiency and emotions. The latest advances in natural language processing and deep learning have made it possible for chatbots to automatically add emojis in their dialogue. Precisely predicting emojis to be added is very challenging, especially in the video comments, where the use of emojis is complex, subtle, and associated with the cultural characteristics of video genres, e.g., anime and dancing. In this article, we first construct a benchmark dataset Bilibili comments dataset with more than 3.9 million comments that contain emojis in the video-sharing website Bilibili and then statistically analyze features of emoji's usage of video genre, comment content, and where an emoji appears in a sentence. According to the analyzed results and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network, we propose a novel model of genre-based multitask GRU (GM-GRU) and its attention-added edition (GM- GRU+) to predict an emoji's category and position in a video comment.

	abstract = {The proliferation of competitive systems in the market is constantly raising the bar for both usability and UX (hedonic \& pragmatic view) in the field of HCI. However, many of today’s technologies lack the essence of usability and UX due to the gap between the practice and the literature. This study explores how the usability of an existing tool, namely the CERO simulation tool can be improved through usercentered design. A pre-study consisting of semi-structured interviews were executed to gather user requirements that gave a premise to base the design choices on. Thereafter, a redesign of the tool in the form of an interactive prototype was developed using the gathered information from the prestudy and literature review. Finally, the developed redesigned prototype was evaluated through a “think-aloud” exercise, together with semi-structured interviews. The result of this study indicates the usability of a product can be improved through a balance between focusing the user’s preferences and the organization’s vision. Further studies on a live version of the final design based on the recommendations from this thesis is proposed, as well as that the system takes the hedonic view of the UX into account.},

We introduce the App Sampling Problem, and study its effects on sets of user review data. We investigate the effects of sampling bias, and techniques for its amelioration in App Store Mining and Analysis, where sampling bias is often unavoidable. We mine 106,891 requests from 2,729,103 user reviews and investigate the properties of apps and reviews from 3 different partitions: the sets with fully complete review data, partially complete review data, and no review data at all. We find that app metrics such as price, rating, and download rank are significantly different between the three completeness levels. We show that correlation analysis can find trends in the data that prevail across the partitions, offering one possible approach to App Store Analysis in the presence of sampling bias.},

These reviews help designers to make exhaustive analyses of competitors, which is one indispensable step in market-driven product design. How to extract critical opinionated sentences associated with some specific features from product online reviews has been investigated by some researchers. However, few of them examined how to employ these valuable resources for competitor analysis. Hence, in this research, a framework is illustrated to select pairs of opinionated representative yet comparative sentences with specific product features from reviews of competitive products. With the help of the techniques on sentiment analysis, opinionated sentences referring to a specific feature are first identified from product online reviews. Then, information representativeness, information comparativeness and information diversity are investigated for the selection of a small number of representative yet comparative opinionated sentences. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated, and three greedy algorithms are proposed to analyze this problem for suboptimal solutions. Finally, with a large amount of real data from Amazon.com, categories of extensive experiments are conducted and the final encouraging results are realized, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Furthermore, we find the key UX issues associated with quantified self technologies, which include data controllability, data integration, data accuracy, data visualization, input complexity, sharing/privacy, design/aesthetics, and engagement.

First, we attempted to infer through sentiment analysis whether a customer is satisfied with a purchase according to their review. Second, a logistic regression model was developed to estimate the impact of various product properties on customer satisfaction scores. Our estimates indicated that customer satisfaction is influenced by drainage mode, loading type, frequency conversion, type, display, colour, and capacity. We further investigate the impact of price and find that customers who buy cheap products should be treated differently from purchasers of expensive items because the relevance of design features on their satisfaction is different. Additionally, we observed that although customers are concerned about noise, perceived noise is not consistent with actual noise levels. We analysed specific reviews and then obtained more detailed information on customer attitudes.},

If the game cannot hold player attention, it will not matter how much fun the game is later on if the player quits early. Worse, if the initial experience was odious enough, the player will dissuade others from playing. Industry advice is to make the game fun from the start to hook the player. In our analysis of over 200 game reviews and interviews with industry professionals, we advance an alternative, complementary solution. New design terminology is introduced such as "holdouts" (what keeps players playing despite poor game design) and the contrast between momentary fun vs. intriguing experiences. Instead of prioritizing fun, we assert that intrigue and information should be seen as equally valuable for helping players determine if they want to continue playing. The first sustained play session (coined "first hour"), when inspected closely, offers lessons for game development and our understanding of how players evaluate games as consumable products.},

The framework aims to distill large volumes of qualitative data into quantitative insights on product features, so that designers can make more informed decisions. The framework combines the elements of online product reviews, design theory and methodology, and data analytics to reveal new insights. The effectiveness of the proposal framework is validated through a case study on product reviews from the e-commerce website, Amazon. The framework demonstrates a statistical approach for analyzing online product reviews. The framework acts as an interface between quantitative outputs and the qualitative and creative process of design. Further analysis of results identifies many of incorporating logical, computational methods into the highly subjective and creative process of design.},

Intelligent analysis of a large volume of online CRs attracts interest from researchers in various fields. However, many research studies only concern sentiment polarity in the product feature level. With these results, designers still need to read a list of reviews to absorb comprehensive CRs. In this research, online reviews are analyzed at a fine-grained level. In particular, aspects of product features and detailed reasons of consumers are extracted from online reviews to inform designers regarding what leads to unsatisfied opinions. This research starts from the identification of product features and the sentiment analysis with the help of pros and cons reviews. Next, the approach of conditional random fields is employed to detect aspects of product features and detailed reasons from online reviews jointly. In addition, a co-clustering algorithm is devised to group similar aspects and reasons to provide a concise description about CRs. Finally, utilizing customer reviews of six mobiles in Amazon.com, a case study is presented to illustrate how the proposed approaches benefit product designers in the elicitation of CRs by the analysis of online opinion data.},

The argument here is that game players have used natural languages to describe computer games and their experiences over time and that the most important characteristics of computer games and game play experience would be reflected in player language. Therefore, the traits of computer games and user experience during game play can be studied by examining the adjectives used by players in online reviews.

Built on a previous lexical analysis of adjectives in online game reviews, it is argued that nouns together with adjectives will likely provide more contextual information than adjectives alone, and therefore the patterns among these words can be used to develop playability heuristics. A revised lexical approach is adopted to analyze nouns and adjectives from 821,122 online reviews. Ninety seven factors emerge from this analysis. Based on the nouns and adjectives highly loaded on these factors, a new process is introduced and 90 playability heuristics are derived. This study significantly expands the current pool of playability heuristics that facilitate the computer game design process. The lexical method adopted in this study demonstrates its effectiveness in developing interface design guidelines based on a large number of online reviews on a system or product. It can be extended to other fields that are human-behavior centered.},

To leverage such data for identifying usability issues, we (I) devise a methodology for building automated extraction tools for usability issues; (II) perform empirical assessment of such tools by training a number of classiﬁers to extract sentences describing usability issues for two digital cameras and a children’s tablet; (III) perform quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the usability issues identiﬁed by the classiﬁers and those identiﬁed and assessed by two traditional methods: heuristic evaluation and think aloud testing. Our results show that it is possible to build and train algorithms for extracting actionable usability issues, but raise serious concerns about the practical future prospects for supplementing traditional evaluation methods with automated extraction algorithms.},

In this sense, we conducted experiments to verify the relationship between the number of stars and the content of review comments. Results indicated that there is information in reviews not properly represented by stars. Thus, we present a sentiment rating generated automatically by aggregating opinions reported in the reviews related to each application. We evaluated this new rating using 26,996 reviews related to six applications present on the Google Play Store. The obtained results allow us to demonstrate that: (1) it is possible and feasible to generate a sentiment rating automatically and (2) the rating is useful for web stores of mobile applications to improve their mechanisms of ranking and recommendation as well as to assist users and developers to evaluate the quality and/or acceptance of the offered mobile applications.},

These categories were reclassified on the three axes representing individual-social, explicit-implicit, and pleasant-unpleasant, which are well known dimensions of user-generated value. As a preliminary study, this categorization is expected to act as a stepping stone in understanding the user-generated content.

These reviews help designers to make exhaustive analyses of competitors, which is one indispensable step in market-driven product design. How to extract critical opinionate sentences associated with some specific features from product online reviews has been investigated by some researchers. However, few of them examined how to select a small number of representative yet comparative sentences for competitor analysis. In this research, a framework is illustrated to select pairs of opinionate sentences referring to a specific feature from reviews of competitive products. With the help of the techniques on sentiment analysis, opinionate sentences referring to a specific feature are first identified from product online reviews. Then, for the selection of a small number of representative yet comparative opinionate sentences, information representativeness, information comparativeness and information diversity are investigated. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated, and three greedy algorithms are proposed to analyze this problem for suboptimal solutions. Finally, with a large amount of real data from Amazon.com, categories of extensive experiments are conducted and the final encouraging results are realized, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

However, there has been limited academic research conducted on disaster apps and how the public perceives their usability. This study explores end-users’ perceptions of the usability of disaster apps. It proposes a conceptual framework based on insights gathered from thematically analyzing online reviews. The study identiﬁes new usability concerns particular to disaster apps’ use: (1) content relevance depends on the app’s purpose and the proximate signiﬁcance of the information to the hazard event’s time and location; (2) app dependability affects users’ perceptions of usability due to the lifesafety association of disaster apps; (3) users perceive advertisements to contribute to their cognitive load; (4) users expect apps to work efﬁciently without unnecessary consumption of critical phone resources; (5) appropriate audio interface can improve usability, as sounds can boost an app’s alerting aspect; and, ﬁnally (6) in-app browsing may potentially enhance users’ impression of the structure of a disaster app. As a result, this study argues for focussed research and development on public-facing disaster apps. Future research should consider the conceptual framework and concerns presented in this study when building design guidelines and theories for disaster apps.},

While the Internet has enabled new forms of communication platform, online stores provide the ability to review apps. These informal online app reviews have become a viral form of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), covering a plethora of issues. In our study, we set ourselves the goal of investigating whether online reviews reveal usability and user experience (UUX) issues, being important quality-in-use characteristics. To address this problem, we used sentiment analysis techniques, with the aim of extracting relevant keywords from eWOM WhatsApp data. Based on the extracted keywords, we next identified the original users' reviews, and individually assigned each attribute and dimension to them. Eventually, the reported issues were thematically synthesized into 7 attributes and 8 dimensions. If one asks whether online reviews reveal genuine UUX issues, in this case, the answer is definitely affirmative.},

Many of these methodologies require qualitative studies with small groups of users based on set guidelines and are time and resource intensive. In this paper, we propose a new technique: “User Review Analysis” that makes use of big data to uncover user needs. The technique consists of collecting and analyzing online User Reviews on shopping sites such as Amazon. The basic idea is that because of the fast and cyclic nature of consumer products development, reviews of Today’s products inform designers on the next product generation. As the data is based on actual product-use experience with similar products, the aggregated insights provide product-in-use experience and brings to light several product design aspects and complement the existing methods.},

We derived an inventory of ML’s impact on current UXR activities and practitioners’ predictions about its potentials. We learned that ML methods may help to automate mundane tasks, complement decisions with data-driven insights, and enrich UXR with insights from users’ emotional worlds. Challenges may arise from a potential obligation to utilize data and a more restrictive access to user data. We embed our insights into recent academic work on ML for UXR and discuss automated UX evaluation as a promising use case for future research.},

	abstract = {In the last few years thousands of scientiﬁc papers have investigated sentiment analysis, several startups that measure opinions on real data have emerged and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from diﬀerent data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at ﬁlling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods’ codes and datasets used in this article, deploying them in a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.},

Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK. However, these tools have been trained on product reviews and movie reviews and, therefore, their results might not be applicable in the software engineering domain. In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to diverging conclusions. Finally, we perform two replications of previously published studies and observe that the results of those studies cannot be confirmed when a different sentiment analysis tool is used.},

Due to these challenges, researchers show interest in sarcasm detection of social media text, especially in tweets. Rapid growth of tweets in volume and its analysis pose major challenges. In this paper, we proposed a Hadoop based framework that captures real time tweets and processes it with a set of algorithms which identifies sarcastic sentiment effectively. We observe that the elapse time for analyzing and processing under Hadoop based framework significantly outperforms the conventional methods and is more suited for real time streaming tweets.},

	abstract = {Emotion recognition has emerged as an important research area which may reveal some valuable input to a variety of purposes. People express their emotions directly or indirectly through their speech, facial expressions, gestures or writings. Many different sources of information, such as speech, text and visual can be used to analyze emotions. Nowadays, writings take many forms of social media posts, micro-blogs, news articles, etc., and the content of these posts can be useful resource for text mining to discover and unhide various aspects, including emotions. Extracting emotions behind these postings is an immense and complicated task. To tackle this problem, researchers from diverse fields are trying to find an efficient way to more precisely detect human emotions from various sources, including text and speech. In this sense, different word-based and sentence-based techniques, machine learning, natural language processing methods, etc., have been used to achieve better accuracy. Analyzing emotions can be helpful in many different domains. One such domain is human computer interaction. With the help of emotion recognition, computers can make better decisions to help users. With the increase in popularity of robotic research, emotion recognition will also help making human–robot interaction more natural. This survey covers existing emotion detection research efforts, emotion models, emotion datasets, emotion detection techniques, their features, limitations and some possible future directions. We focus on reviewing research efforts analyzing emotions based on text and speech. We investigated different feature sets that have been used in existing methodologies.

	abstract = {Aims and objectives To explore in depth discomfort in intensive care as experienced by patients and attended to by critical care nurses. Background Discomfort in illness is complex and persistent, and its alleviation is a challenge for nurses working in intensive care units (ICU). In previous studies, we showed that ICU patients described little actual pain but suffer from much discomfort. Critical care nurses had a systematic approach to the treatment of pain, but were more haphazard in dealing with other types of discomfort. Design Secondary qualitative analysis of data from two previous exploratory studies. Methods Content analysis was used on existing data from 28 interviews with ICU patients, and 16 field notes and interviews with critical care nurses. Kolcaba's Comfort Theory was applied for further analysis. The COREQ checklist was used. Results Three themes, “Being deprived of a functioning body”, “Being deprived of a functioning mind” and “Being deprived of integrity” characterised the discomfort experienced by ICU patients. The nurses appeared to attend to all areas of discomfort expressed by patients. In need of, and providing acknowledgment and alleviation became a common overarching theme. We identified a comfort gap caused by the discrepancy between the patients’ needs and the nurses’ achievements in fulfilling these needs. Conclusions A gap exists between ICU patients’ comfort needs and nurses’ achievements in fulfilling these, indicating that discomfort currently is an inevitable part of the critical illness trajectory. Increased knowledge about how the brain is affected in ICU patients and more systematic approaches to assessing comfort needs and enhancing comfort may support nurses in fulfilling patient needs and possibly diminish the existing comfort gap. Relevance for clinical practice An increased understanding of the complex experience of discomfort in ICU patients may bring about more systematic approaches to enhance comfort and direct for education and further research.},

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used too for automatically expand CBE. The CBE attributes are a score of Valence (V), Arousal (A), Dominance (D) and categorical label emotion. Categorical label emotion based on six basic emotion of Ekman. Based on experiment results, it is known that CBE is able to improve the accuracy in detection of emotions. F-Measure using WNA+ANEW is 0.50 and F-Measure using CBE with expanding is 0.61.},

In this paper, we review the work that has been done in identifying emotion expressions in text and argue that although many techniques, methodologies, and models have been created to detect emotion in text, there are various reasons that make these methods insufficient. Although, there is an essential need to improve the design and architecture of current systems, factors such as the complexity of human emotions, and the use of implicit and metaphorical language in expressing it, lead us to think that just re-purposing standard methodologies will not be enough to capture these complexities, and it is important to pay attention to the linguistic intricacies of emotion expression.},

This paper is concerned with the detection of emotions evoked in a reader by social media. Compared to classical sentiment analysis conducted from the writer’s perspective, analysis from the reader’s perspective can be more meaningful when applied to social media. We propose an affective topic model with the intention to bridge the gap between social media materials and a reader’s emotions by introducing an intermediate layer. The proposed model can be used to classify the social emotions of unlabeled documents and to generate a social emotion lexicon.

Design  An exploratory qualitative study using thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. Setting  A community dance group in a UK health centre. Participants  Convenience sample of long-­term dance group participants. Intervention  Weekly community dance sessions designed for people with breathlessness, lasting 75 min, led by a trained community dance leader.Results  Convenience sample of eight participants, six females, aged 57–87 years (mean 75), with a median 2-­year attendance at weekly dance sessions. Long-­term attendance was driven by strongly held beliefs regarding the health and well-­being benefits of participation. Four key themes were identified: dance as (1) a holistically beneficial activity, with physical and psychosocial health benefits including improved or maintained physical fitness and psychological well-­being, and reduced need for healthcare; (2) an integral part of their life; (3) an enjoyable activity; and (4) a source of deep social cohesion.Conclusions  Dance group participants perceived a broad range of health benefits of relevance to the biopsychosocial impacts of their respiratory disease. The themes identified are useful in the ongoing planning and evaluation of dance as a holistic complex intervention for people with CRD. Further research is required to assess the extent of health impacts identified, and how dance might be most effectively placed as an option in the management of CRD.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2458-14-951},
	abstract = {Background: Exergaming has been proposed as an innovative method for physical activity promotion. However, large effectiveness studies are rare. In January 2011, dance mat systems were introduced in secondary schools in two districts in England with the aim of promoting an innovative opportunity for physical activity. The aim of this natural experiment was to examine the effect of introducing the dance mat exergaming systems on physical activity and health-related outcomes in 11–13 year old students using a non-randomised controlled design and mixed methods.
Methods: Participants were recruited from five schools in intervention districts (n = 280) and two schools in neighbouring control districts (n = 217). Data on physical activity (accelerometer), anthropometrics (weight, BMI and percentage of body fat), aerobic fitness (20-m multistage shuttle run test), health-related quality of life (Kidscreen questionnaire), self-efficacy (children’s physical activity self-efficacy survey), school attendance, focus groups with children and interviews with teachers were collected at baseline and approximately 12 months follow-up.
Results: There was a negative intervention effect on total physical activity (−65.4 cpm CI: −12.6 to −4.7), and light and sedentary physical activity when represented as a percentage of wear time (Light: −2.3\% CI: −4.5 to 0.2; Sedentary: 3.3\% CI: 0.7 to 5.9). However, compliance with accelerometers at follow-up was poor. There was a significant positive intervention effect on weight (−1.7 kg, 95\% CI: −2.9 to −0.4), BMI (−0.9 kg/m2, 95\% CI: −1.3 to −0.4) and percentage of body fat (−2.2\%, 95\% CI: −4.2 to −0.2). There was also evidence of improvement in some health-related quality of life parameters: psychological well-being (2.5, 95\% CI: 0.1 to 4.8) and autonomy and parent relation (4.2, 95\% CI: 1.4 to 7.0).
Conclusions: The implementation of a dance mat exergaming scheme was associated with improvement in anthropometric measurements and parameters of health-related quality of life. However, the mechanisms of these benefits are unclear as there was insufficient data from physical activity to draw robust conclusions. Qualitative findings suggest that there was declining support for the initiative over time, meaning that potential benefits may not have been achieved.},

that the concept of usability evolved from a narrow focus on individual performance to a more inclusive concept of experience

which, together, seem to reflect those pervading the field of usability. We argue that the movement away from the strictly
cognitive, performance-oriented concerns to embracing emotion and eventually social and cultural aspects can largely be attributed
to two forces. One is a change in tasks, technologies, and the objectives of systems. The other is the realization that performance
alone in the cognitive sense is not enough to account for the richness of phenomena influencing people’s interactions with
technology. We then discuss the importance of aesthetics and emotion, and finally, usability in the context of collaborative
and social computing.},

Although there is not yet a consensus on a single definition of information design, one that I like is making "information accessible and usable to people" (Sless, 1992, p. 1). It is not enough to design well: We must also achieve information design that is usable. We therefore need to establish what "usable" means, so in this chapter I present five dimensions of usability, which can be used in several ways: • As a model, they provide a way to understand what kind of usability is needed in different contexts; • As a tool, they help guide the design process, suggesting both a general approach and specific choices; • For evaluation, they are both useful as a way of understanding why a design is failing, and suggest appropriate techniques to get the design right. This multifaceted view of usability allows designers of both complex and simpler products to understand user requirements and evaluate the success of the design. The work of an information designer shares elements with others including user experience designers, information architects, graphic artists, interaction designers, user interface designers, usability engi-neers, writers, content managers, indexers, and quite a few more.},

The best single feature is bigram with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect depression with 80\% accuracy and 0.80 F1 scores. The strength and effectiveness of the combined features (LIWC+LDA+bigram) are most successfully demonstrated with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier resulting in the top performance for depression detection reaching 91\% accuracy and 0.93 F1 scores.

	abstract = {Background  Heuristic evaluation is used in human–computer interaction studies to assess the usability of information systems. Nielsen's widely used heuristics, first developed in 1990, are appropriate for general usability but do not specifically address usability in systems that produce information visualizations., Objective  This article develops a heuristic evaluation checklist that can be used to evaluate systems that produce information visualizations. Principles from Nielsen's heuristics were combined with heuristic principles developed by prior researchers specifically to evaluate information visualization.
, 
Methods
We used nominal group technique to determine an appropriate final set. The combined existing usability principles and associated factors were distributed via email to a group of 12 informatics experts from a range of health care disciplines. Respondents were asked to rate each factor on its importance as an evaluation heuristic for visualization systems on a scale from 1 (definitely don't include) to 10 (definitely include). The distribution of scores for each item were calculated. A median score of ≥8 represented consensus for inclusion in the final checklist.
, 
Results
Ten of 12 experts responded with rankings and written comments. The final checklist consists of 10 usability principles (7 general and 3 specific to information visualization) substantiated by 49 usability factors. Three nursing informatics experts then used the checklist to evaluate a vital sign dashboard developed for home care nurses, using a task list designed to explore the full functionality of the dashboard. The experts used the checklist without difficulty, and indicated that it covered all major usability problems encountered during task completion.
, 
Conclusion
The growing capacity to generate and electronically process health data suggests that data visualization will be increasingly important. A checklist of usability heuristics for evaluating information visualization systems can contribute to assuring high quality in electronic data systems developed for health care.},

We measured emotional changes caused by game play using a QOL questionnaire specialized in the detection of the mental change (POMS-Brief Form) in Interrupted Time-Series Design. As a result, the analysis of variance showed that in certain cases some negative feelings such as uneasiness and anger are reduced significantly by game play, and such effect is strengthened by repeatedly playing a personal favorite. Furthermore, it was indicated that an appreciative evaluation of the game correlates with a positive effect. Therefore it became clear that there is a need to consider the test participant's subjective evaluation of the game during the experiment. Additionally, the feelings affected were clearly different in each of the 16 titles analyzed. Therefore, a new classification of games from the viewpoint of the POMS change in QOL is possible.},

Nevertheless UX design presents some risks, such as providing users with experiences that they do not wish. Furthermore, UX methodologies lack prescriptive tools for guiding designers. This paper establishes a link between UX research and Affordance theory and postulates the concept of Experience Affordances. Affordances represent a first step toward the development of prescriptive methods and help preventing designer from imposing experiences to users. Thus, a framework for describing product experience in terms of affordances is exposed and discussed by analysing exemplary products. In concluding the paper, the implications of the framework are presented.},

We have fused Electroencephalogram (EEG) waves of user and corresponding global textual comments of the video to understand the user’s preference more precisely. In our framework, the users were asked to watch the video-advertisement and simultaneously EEG signals were recorded. Valence scores were obtained using self-report for each video. A higher valence corresponds to intrinsic attractiveness of the user. Furthermore, the multimedia data that comprised of the comments posted by global viewers, were retrieved and processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for sentiment analysis. Textual contents from review comments were analyzed to obtain a score to understand sentiment nature of the video. A regression technique based on Random forest was used to predict the rating of an advertisement using EEG data. Finally, EEG based rating is combined with NLP-based sentiment score to improve the overall prediction. The study was carried out using 15 video clips of advertisements available online. Twenty five participants were involved in our study to analyze our proposed system. The results are encouraging and these suggest that the proposed multimodal approach can achieve lower RMSE in rating prediction as compared to the prediction using only EEG data.},

This paper presents a methodology to create such a lexicon called Senti-N-Gram. Proposed rule-based approach extracts the n-grams sentiment scores from a random corpus containing product reviews and corresponding numeric rating in five-point scale. The scores from this automated procedure are compared with that of the human annotators using t-test and found to be statistically equivalent. The paper also proposes a sentiment classification methodology by using a ratio based approach based on counts of positive and negative sentences of a document.

We analyzed tweets written in both English and Portuguese. In this ﬁrst step of our work we correlate this information with key events of the evolution of the pandemic in Portugal during March, which was the most critical period in Portugal. Our ﬁndings show that the sentiment analysis of covid-related twees is consistent with our hypothesis that negative emotions would intensify as the pandemic progressed. The preliminary results obtained stand as proof of concept that the analysis of real-time tweets or other social media messages through sentiment analysis can be an important tool for behavioural and well-being tracking.},

Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern ﬁction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered ﬁlter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath’s data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC.},

However, the free nature of tagging presents some challenges regarding the search and exploration of tag spaces. In order to deal with these challenges we propose the Semantic Tag Clustering Search (STCS) framework. The framework first groups syntactic variations using several measures based on the Levenshtein distance and the cosine similarity based on tag co-occurrences. We find that a measure that combines the newly introduced variable cost Levenshtein similarity measure with the cosine similarity significantly outperforms the other methods we evaluated in terms of precision. After grouping syntactic variations, the framework clusters semantically related tags using the cosine similarity based on tag co-occurrences. We compare the STCS framework to a state-of-the-art clustering technique and find that the STCS framework performs significantly better in terms of precision. For the evaluation we used a large data set gathered from Flickr, which contains all the pictures uploaded in the year 2009.},

In this work, we introduce such an approach, the Term Based Semantic Clusters (TBSeC) that employs terms to create distinctive semantic concept clusters. These clusters are ranked using a semantic similarity function which in turn defines a semantic feature space that can be used for text classification. Our method is evaluated in an invoice classification task. Compared to well-known content representation methods the proposed method performs competitively.},

	abstract = {Objective
Automatic monitoring of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), defined as adverse patient outcomes caused by medications, is a challenging research problem that is currently receiving significant attention from the medical informatics community. In recent years, user-posted data on social media, primarily due to its sheer volume, has become a useful resource for ADR monitoring. Research using social media data has progressed using various data sources and techniques, making it difficult to compare distinct systems and their performances. In this paper, we perform a methodical review to characterize the different approaches to ADR detection/extraction from social media, and their applicability to pharmacovigilance. In addition, we present a potential systematic pathway to ADR monitoring from social media.
Methods
We identified studies describing approaches for ADR detection from social media from the Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases, and the Google Scholar search engine. Studies that met our inclusion criteria were those that attempted to extract ADR information posted by users on any publicly available social media platform. We categorized the studies according to different characteristics such as primary ADR detection approach, size of corpus, data source(s), availability, and evaluation criteria.
Results
Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria, with fifteen (68\%) published within the last two years. However, publicly available annotated data is still scarce, and we found only six studies that made the annotations used publicly available, making system performance comparisons difficult. In terms of algorithms, supervised classification techniques to detect posts containing ADR mentions, and lexicon-based approaches for extraction of ADR mentions from texts have been the most popular.
Conclusion
Our review suggests that interest in the utilization of the vast amounts of available social media data for ADR monitoring is increasing. In terms of sources, both health-related and general social media data have been used for ADR detection—while health-related sources tend to contain higher proportions of relevant data, the volume of data from general social media websites is significantly higher. There is still very limited amount of annotated data publicly available , and, as indicated by the promising results obtained by recent supervised learning approaches, there is a strong need to make such data available to the research community.},

Public sentiment related to future events, such as demonstrations or parades, indicate public attitude and therefore may be applied while trying to estimate the level of disruption and disorder during such events. Consequently, sentiment analysis of social media content may be of interest for different organisations, especially in security and law enforcement sectors. This paper presents a new lexicon-based sentiment analysis algorithm that has been designed with the main focus on real time Twitter content analysis. The algorithm consists of two key components, namely sentiment normalisation and evidence-based combination function, which have been used in order to estimate the intensity of the sentiment rather than positive/negative label and to support the mixed sentiment classification process. Finally, we illustrate a case study examining the relation between negative sentiment of twitter posts related to English Defence League and the level of disorder during the organisation’s related events.},

As a result, users often find it challenging to discover useful information or more on the topic being discussed from such content. Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are used to analyze the massive amount of textual social media data available online, including topic modeling techniques that have gained popularity in recent years. This paper investigates the topic modeling subject and its common application areas, methods and tools. Also, we examine and compare five frequently used topic modeling methods, as applied to short textual social data, to show their benefits practically in detecting important topics. These methods are Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Random Projection, and Principal Component Analysis. Two textual datasets were selected to evaluate the performance of included topic modeling methods based on the topic quality and some standard statistical evaluation metrics, like recall, precision, F-score and topic coherence. As a result, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization methods delivered more meaningful extracted topics and obtained good results. The paper sheds light on some common topic modeling methods in a short text context and provides direction for researchers who seek to apply these methods.},

It can assist in search engines, recommender systems and market research. With the growth of the internet, numerous business websites have been deployed to support online shopping and booking services as well as to allow online reviewing and commenting the services in forms of either business forums or social networks. Mining opinion automatically using the reviews from such online platforms is not only useful for customers to seek for advice, but also necessary for business to understand their customers and to improve their services. There are currently several approaches for sentiment analysis. In this research, we proposed a lexicon-based method using sentiment dictionaries with a heuristic method for data pre-processing. We showed that our method outperformed state-of-the-art lexicon-based methods.},

	abstract = {With the rapid increase in social networks and blogs, the social media services are increasingly being used by online communities to share their views and experiences about a particular product, policy and event. Due to economic importance of these reviews, there is growing trend of writing user reviews to promote a product. Nowadays, users prefer online blogs and review sites to purchase products. Therefore, user reviews are considered as an important source of information in Sentiment Analysis (SA) applications for decision making. In this work, we exploit the wealth of user reviews, available through the online forums, to analyze the semantic orientation of words by categorizing them into +ive and -ive classes to identify and classify emoticons, modifiers, general-purpose and domain-specific words expressed in the public’s feedback about the products. However, the un-supervised learning approach employed in previous studies is becoming less efficient due to data sparseness, low accuracy due to non-consideration of emoticons, modifiers, and presence of domain specific words, as they may result in inaccurate classification of users’ reviews. Lexicon-enhanced sentiment analysis based on Rule-based classification scheme is an alternative approach for improving sentiment classification of users’ reviews in online communities. In addition to the sentiment terms used in general purpose sentiment analysis, we integrate emoticons, modifiers and domain specific terms to analyze the reviews posted in online communities. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we considered users reviews in three domains. The results obtained from different experiments demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes limitations of previous methods and the performance of the sentiment analysis is improved after considering emoticons, modifiers, negations, and domain specific terms when compared to baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Business travel as a form of work-related mobility has been an integrated part of working life in the global economy, generating great impact on individuals. Although prior studies address some relevant health consequences, there is a lack of research considering multiple dimensions of health or providing a deeper contextual analysis. Drawing on the multi-dimensional health concept and the framework of mobilities and health, the present study further demonstrates the complexity and dynamic of this issue. Through in-depth interviews with frequent business travellers, it was found that frequent business trips as a part of work and life bring about a range of physical, psychological and social health impacts, which shows different characteristics and interact with each other. Perceptions of these health consequences vary among respondents with different travel patterns and personal situations. Moreover, the findings indicate that there may exist a paradoxical fact: as business travellers with longer experiences of traveling work tend to become more aware of the potential health cost of highly mobile lifestyles, however, the health impairment has generated and accumulated at the later life stages and can hardly be reversed even they stop traveling. Therefore, it is significant and meaningful to raise the public concern on this issue by stressing the dark side of business travel instead of only glamorizing it. This study contributes to previous literature on mobility and health by demonstrating the characteristics of business travel as a mobile working context and how it affects travellers’ health in multi-dimensions. It also provides managerial implications for individuals and organizations.},

We evaluate the quality of the topic predictions for the same document in different languages.

            An increasing body of evidence notes the health benefits of arts engagement and participation. However, specific health effects and optimal modes and ‘doses’ of arts participation remain unclear, limiting evidence-based recommendations and prescriptions. The performing arts are the most popular form of arts participation, presenting substantial scope for established interest to be leveraged into positive health outcomes. Results of a three-component umbrella review (PROSPERO ID \#: CRD42020191991) of relevant systematic reviews (33), epidemiologic studies (9) and descriptive studies (87) demonstrate that performing arts participation is broadly health promoting activity. Beneficial effects of performing arts participation were reported in healthy (non-clinical) children, adolescents, adults, and older adults across 17 health domains (9 supported by moderate-high quality evidence (
            GRADE criteria
            )). Positive health effects were associated with as little as 30 (
            acute effects)

            ) and exercise-based (
            aerobic dance, Zumba
            ) modes of dance linked to the broadest health benefits. Links between specific health effects and performing arts modes/doses remain unclear and specific conclusions are limited by a still young and disparate evidence base. Further research is necessary, with this umbrella review providing a critical knowledge foundation.},

User reviews are recognized as a valuable source to improve APPs and increase the value for users. With the sharp increase in the amount of user reviews, how to effectively and efficiently analyze the user reviews and identify potential and critical user needs from them to improve the APPs becomes a challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically identify requirements information and further classify them into functional and non-functional requirements from user reviews, using a combination of information retrieval technique (TF-IDF) and NLP technique (regular expression) with human intervention in keywords selection for requirements identification and classification. We validated the proposed approach with the user reviews collected from a popular APP iBooks in English App Store, and further investigated the cost and return of our approach: how the size of sample reviews for keywords selection (cost) affects the classification results in precision, recall, and F-measure (return). The results show that when setting an appropriate size of sample reviews, our approach receives a relatively stable precision, recall, and F-measure of requirements classification, in particular for non-functional requirements, which is meaningful and practical for APP developers to elicit requirements from user reviews.},

Thus, automated approaches have been proposed in literature with the aim of reducing the eﬀort required for analyzing feedback contained in user reviews via automatic classiﬁcation/prioritization according to speciﬁc topics. In this paper, we introduce SURF (Summarizer of User Reviews Feedback), a novel approach to condense the enormous amount of information that developers of popular apps have to manage due to user feedback received on a daily basis. SURF relies on a conceptual model for capturing user needs useful for developers performing maintenance and evolution tasks. Then it uses sophisticated summarisation techniques for summarizing thousands of reviews and generating an interactive, structured and condensed agenda of recommended software changes. We performed an end-to-end evaluation of SURF on user reviews of 17 mobile apps (5 of them developed by Sony Mobile), involving 23 developers and researchers in total. Results demonstrate high accuracy of SURF in summarizing reviews and the usefulness of the recommended changes. In evaluating our approach we found that SURF helps developers in better understanding user needs, substantially reducing the time required by developers compared to manually analyzing user (change) requests and planning future software changes.},

Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and ratings. For this we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classiﬁcation, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classiﬁcation accuracy. When combined with natural language processing, the classiﬁcation precision got between 70-95\% while the recall between 80-90\%. Multiple binary classiﬁers outperformed single multiclass classiﬁers. Our results impact the design of review analytics tools which help app vendors, developers, and users to deal with the large amount of reviews, ﬁlter critical reviews, and assign them to the appropriate stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Successful open source communities are constantly looking for new members and helping them become active developers. A common approach for developer onboarding in open source projects is to let newcomers focus on relevant yet easy-to-solve issues to familiarize themselves with the code and the community. The goal of this research is twofold. First, we aim at automatically identifying issues that newcomers can resolve by analyzing the history of resolved issues by simply using the title and description of issues. Second, we aim at automatically identifying issues, that can be resolved by newcomers who later become active developers. We mined the issue trackers of three large open source projects and extracted natural language features from the title and description of resolved issues. In a series of experiments, we optimized and compared the accuracy of four supervised classiﬁers to address our research goals. Random Forest, achieved up to 91\% precision (F1-score 72\%) towards the ﬁrst goal while for the second goal, Decision Tree achieved a precision of 92\% (F1-score 91\%). A qualitative evaluation gave insights on what information in the issue description is helpful for newcomers. Our approach can be used to automatically identify, label, and recommend issues for newcomers in open source software projects based only on the text of the issues.},

Positive emotions will also keep people from stress. happy feelings are the emotions most often talked about and known.

Nonetheless, emotions in design are far more than simply using satisfaction and frustration as criteria, noting how pleasant or unpleasant a product is, or listing a number of emotions elicited during an evaluation. Evaluating the emotional impact of a user interaction as part of a usability evaluation requires that emotions be adequately assessed and, most importantly, interpreted to identify their source. This article aims to present a method and process of Emotional Profiling to show how emotions may be utilized to aid usability professionals in further understanding the emotional reactions to human-system interactions, thereby identifying factors that enhance or detract from the user experience.},

Results indicated insignificant differences in usability metrics but numerous significant differences between emotional responses of users.

There are varieties of experiences, good and bad, and we need to characterise these varieties if we are to improve user experience. In this paper we argue that enchantment is a useful concept to facilitate closer relationships between people and technology. But enchantment is a complex concept in need of some clarification. So we explore how enchantment has been used in the discussions of technology and examine experiences of film and cell phones to see how enchantment with technology is possible. Based on these cases, we identify the sensibilities that help designers design for enchantment, including the specific sensuousness of a thing, senses of play, paradox and openness, and the potential for transformation. We use these to analyse digital jewellery in order to suggest how it can be made more enchanting. We conclude by relating enchantment to varieties of experience.},

All adolescents were between 16 and 19 years of age (M=16.80, SD=0.89) and were recruited from three municipalities in Ontario. Each adolescent participated in a face-to-face, qualitative interview. Content analysis revealed descriptions of body image that were similar across the sample. The main themes emerging from this work include (a) the “moderately slim” and “moderately muscular” ideal, (b) the “slim and curvy paradox,” (c) “ideal” privilege, (d) having an “expected” appearance, and (e) wishful comparisons.

	abstract = {Extraction–Transform–Load (ETL) processes comprise complex data workflows, which are responsible for the maintenance of a Data Warehouse. Their practical importance is denoted by the fact that a plethora of ETL tools currently constitutes a multi-million dollars market. However, each one of them follows a different design and modeling technique and internal language. So far, the research community has not agreed upon the basic characteristics of ETL tools. Hence, there is a necessity for a unified way to assess ETL workflows. In this paper, we investigate the main characteristics and peculiarities of ETL processes and we propose a principled organization of test suites for the problem of experimenting with ETL scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper structures a novel vision for OLAPby fundamentally redefining several of the pillars on which OLAP has been based for the last 20 years. We redefine OLAP queries, in order to move to higher degrees of abstraction from roll-up’s and drill-down’s, and we propose a set of novel intentional OLAP operators, namely, describe, assess, explain, predict, and suggest, which express the user’s need for results. We fundamentally redefine what a query answer is, and escape from the constraint that the answer is a set of tuples; on the contrary, we complement the set of tuples with models (typically, but not exclusively, results of data mining algorithms over the involved data) that concisely represent the internal structure or correlations of the data. Due to the diverse nature of the involved models, we come up (for the first time ever, to the best of our knowledge) with a unifying framework for them, that places its pillars on the extension of each data cell of a cube with information about the models that pertain to it — practically converting the small parts that build up the models to data that annotate each cell. We exploit this data-to-model mapping to provide highlights of the data, by isolating data and models that maximize the delivery of new information to the user. We introduce a novel method for assessing the surprise that a new query result brings to the user, with respect to the information contained in previous results the user has seen via a new interestingness measure. The individual parts of our proposal are integrated in a new data model for OLAP, which we call the Intentional Analytics Model. We complement our contribution with a list of significant open problems for the community to address.},

The structure of those data, commonly supplied by means of REST APIs, is continuously evolving. Thus data analysts need to adapt their analytical processes after each API release. This gets more challenging when performing an integrated or historical analysis. To cope with such complexity, in this paper, we present the Big Data Integration ontology, the core construct to govern the data integration process under schema evolution by systematically annotating it with information regarding the schema of the sources. We present a query rewriting algorithm that, using the annotated ontology, converts queries posed over the ontology to queries over the sources. To cope with syntactic evolution in the sources, we present an algorithm that semi-automatically adapts the ontology upon new releases. This guarantees ontology-mediated queries to correctly retrieve data from the most recent schema version as well as correctness in historical queries. A functional and performance evaluation on real-world APIs is performed to validate our approach.},

ETL workflows are complex design structures that run under strict performance requirements and their optimization is crucial for satisfying business objectives. In this paper, we deal with the problem of scheduling the execution of ETL activities (a.k.a. transformations, tasks, operations), with the goal of minimizing ETL execution time and allocated memory. We investigate the effects of four scheduling policies on different flow structures and configurations and experimentally show that the use of different scheduling policies may improve ETL performance in terms of memory consumption and execution time. First, we examine a simple, fair scheduling policy. Then, we study the pros and cons of two other policies: the first opts for emptying the largest input queue of the flow and the second for activating the operation (a.k.a. activity) with the maximum tuple consumption rate. Finally, we examine a fourth policy that combines the advantages of the latter two in synergy with flow parallelization.},

	abstract = {Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for monitoring public health. Using Twitter’s public streaming API, we compiled over 5.3 million “breast cancer” related tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage. Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.},
